        <p>
          I'm reading the Bible with the help of the amazing
          <a href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/">"Bible In A Year"</a>
          podcast by the incredible Fr. Mike Schmitz. He reads the Sacred
          Scriptures not in the order of the books, but divided in a way where
          passages of multiple books are read each day in a way that the
          readings are in-context, making the narrative easier to follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's also the book
          <a href="https://ascensionpress.com/">"Walking with God: A Journey Through the Bible"</a>
          by Tim Gray and Jeff Cavins, which follows the same timeline. The
          podcast uses the Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition. I read
          it through the Ascension Press app.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the idea is to listen/read day-by-day so you can finish in
          a year, I fail miserably at that goal 😅. Both because of lack of
          discipline and want/need to read multiple times the same passages so
          I can understand better what's bein said, because there is so much
          to learn and so many layers of meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are my notes, thoughts, interpretations and questions about
          the Bible. I'm a layman and recent convert, not a theologian, so
          take this as an amateur's <em>exegesis</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you hover over the Bible references, you'll see the text of the
          verse. If you click on it, you'll be taken to the Bible passage in
          <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">Bible Gateway</a>.

      <section class="bible-day">
        <h1>Day 1 - Creation</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 1 & 2; Psalm 19</h2>

        <p>
          The creation story of genesis is unique among creation stories
          because all other stories involve a god or gods creating the world
          out of violence, destruction, sex or desire for having slaves to do
          the work or entertain them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Differently, the Hebrew word used in Genesis to talk about the
          creation is <em>“Bara”</em>, which means create out of nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Why did God create us?</b> <br />
          To share in his perfect and good divine nature,
          <b>“to share in his blessed life”</b> as the Catechism puts it. We
          do that by <b>labor</b> (working as God has worked to create us),
          <b>leisure</b> (as God rested after work), and <b>love</b> (as God
          loves us and is infinite love).
        </p>
        <p>
          Genesis also establishes where we get our dignity from. It is not
          from our strength, power, beauty, wisdom or a government. We get our
          dignity from the fact that every human being - male and female - is
          made in God’s image and likeness.
        </p>

        <p>
          A little poem about the creation of Eve and male/female equality in
          dignity:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “When God took Eve from Adam,<br />
          He did not take her from his head to Lord over him,<br />
          Nor from his foot to be walked upon by him.<br />
          He took her from his side, to walk with him;<br />
          From beneath his arms to be guarded by him;<br />
          And from near his heart to be loved by him.”<br />
        </blockquote>
        <p>—A little bit cheesy, but I like it!</p>
      </section>

      <section class="bible-day">
        <h1>Day 2 - The Fall</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 3 & 4; Psalm 104</h2>

        <p>
          The snake doesn’t dismiss God’s existence or even his authority. The
          snake questions the Lord’s trustworthiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sin is the fallacy that we can make our own moral rules, different
          from the divine objective moral law.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are limited and fallible beings, without the capacity of fully
          understanding the consequences of our actions. When we try to
          deviate from objective morality made by the perfect and infinitely
          good God, we are inviting suffering into our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge is not whether you believe in God. It is if you belong
          to him, or will you make yourself your own god. You belong to God
          when you obey him because you know He loves you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pain and suffering of Adam and Eve are not curses. They are
          remedies. Because they failed to choose love, they have to learn
          that love always involves sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Love requires sacrifice. For Eve to love her husband and bring forth
          a family, she’ll have to endure a lot of pain in childbearing. For
          Adam to love his wife and his family, to protect and provide for
          them, he will have to endure physical pain of labor. In these ways,
          they will learn that to love requires sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          How do we know God is not just punishing them? Because he guards the
          tree of life (Gen 3:22) and clothed them (Gen 3:21).
        </p>

        <p>
          He guards the tree of life because if they eat the fruit of the tree
          of life, they will live forever. And God seeing their brokenness in
          that state, can’t allow they living forever that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          God clothing them is the sign that even in this state of sin, God
          still cares for them and continues to provide for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          God clothes them in leather skins (Gen 3:21), which means that
          something had to die for God to love them. Again, this connection
          between love and sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the Fall, things escalate quickly, with fratricide happening
          (Gen 4:8) soon after. Again demonstrating how disastrous the
          consequences of our sins can be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why Abel’s offering was accepted, but Cain’s not? It is unknowable,
          but one hypothesis would be that Abel offered the “first fruits”
          (Gen 4:4), while Cain offered “whatever”.
        </p>

        <p>
          Love requires sacrifice, and to love God we also need to sacrifice
          something. This is clear when we pray: we are sacrificing our time
          to love God.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we pray are we offering our best time, our “first fruits”? Or
          are we just offering “whatever”, what’s left in our day, thus making
          our sacrifice meaningless?
        </p>

        <p>
          But God, in his infinite mercy, will forgive our bad offerings and
          accept us again if we do good (Gen 4:7). And even with all the
          temptation, we do not have to sin. Not only that, but we need to
          learn how to control ourselves, master our emotions and choose to
          not to sin.
        </p>

        <p>Questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Did God lie? Because they didn’t die when they ate the fruit.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Their death was spiritual. They committed a mortal sin, losing
              their holiness and separating themselves from God.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            Why God says that Adam and Eve have become like them? (Gen 3:22)
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Before eating the fruit, Adam and Eve had a childlike innocence,
              and after eating they gained a knowledge about good and evil,
              which made them more similar to God in this aspect. But this
              came at the cost of the loss of innocence and the introduction
              of sin into their lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              It could also be a somewhat ironic statement. In their quest to
              become like God, they separated themselves further away from
              God, achieving the opposite consequence and bringing brokenness
              into their lives.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>Who is Cain’s wife?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              It seems that there were other humans, because incest is
              contrary to natural law.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can’t be other humans because all humans are descendants of
              Adam and Eve. Furthermore, if there were other humans, they
              wouldn’t be stained by the original sin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thus, it has to be that Cain’s wife was a sister or niece or
              grandniece. And that, by some unknown factor, incest was not a
              biological or moral problem in that specific circumstance.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h1>Day 3 - Noah's Ark</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 5 & 6; Psalm 136</h2>

        <p>Questions:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>What these long lifetimes mean?</li>

          <li>
            Did Enoch go to heaven? How if Jesus didn’t pay the price for us
            to go to heaven yet?
          </li>

          <li>Why does the Bible emphasize genealogies so much?</li>

          <li>
            Nephilim is translated as “giants” in Portuguese, but naphal is
            the Hebrew word for “to fall”.
          </li>

          <li>
            How the biblical flood story differs from other flood stories?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Genesis chapter 4 and chapter 5 present two descendent lines of Adam
          & Eve. The Seth’s line and Cain’s line.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/bible-day-3-noah-genealogy.png" alt="Noah's Genealogy" />
          <figcaption>
            Noah's Genealogy, taken from
            <a
              href="https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/83778/was-noah-and-or-his-family-fully-or-partially-descendant-from-cain"><em>"Was
                Noah and/or his family fully or partially descendant
                from Cain?"</em></a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          When Seth’s line is presented, it is presented by first pointing out
          that Seth was made in the image and likeness of Adam (alluding to
          the passage that Adam was made in the image and likeness of God).
        </p>

        <p>
          Seth’s line has righteous men like Enoch, that “walked with God”
          (Gen 5:24) and Noah, the one that “shall bring us relief from our work
          and from the toil of our hands.” (Gen 5:29).
        </p>

        <p>
          When Cain’s line is presented, we are presented with Lamech, a
          polygamist (Gen 4:19) and murderer (Gen 4:23).
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>
            And why does Lamech says “If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly
            Lamech seventy-sevenfold.” (Gen 4:24)?
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          He is referring to the promise God made to protect Cain in Gen 4:15,
          but God put the mark in Cain and not on his descendants as well.
          Thus, this is a claim Lamech is making himself. This seems to
          describe a progression on the effects of sin of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The greater degree of vengeance might describe a progression of
          violence (with the crime committed being worse), a culture of
          retribution or Lamech’s bragging about his dominance, which
          emphasizes his and society’s moral decay.
        </p>

        <p><b>Who are the sons of God and daughters of men?</b></p>

        <p>
          Given the clear distinction of the Seth’s and Cain’s line
          previously, it would make sense that “sons of God” refers to the
          Seth’s line, specially giving the description that Seth was made in
          the image and likeness of Adam. Thus the daughters of men would be
          the Cain’s line.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this interpretation is correct, the story seems to be about the
          progressive degradation of the “righteous” line, with the
          intermarriage symbolizing the adoption of morally evil practices of
          the other line, one of them polygamy (Gen 6:2), which is previously
          associated with violence (Lamech’s narrative).
        </p>

        <p>
          Earth is now fully corrupted and full of violence (Gen 6:11-12). But
          in amidst all this chaos, there is one righteous man, Noah, that
          walks with God, and is blameless in his generation (Gen 6:9).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="bible-day">
        <h1>Day 4 - The Flood</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 7, 8, & 9; Psalm 1</h2>

        <p>
          The flood and Noah’s ark is one the best-known narratives in the Bible. What usually is not known is that
          there are many other flood narratives that were written in the region of Ancient Mesopotamia. But similarly to
          the creation story, the Bible’s Flood narrative is unique.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Babylonian story, known as Antra-Hasis, gods make humans to be used as labor force, and when these
          humans start to overpopulate earth, the gods decide to send plagues and famines to control the population.
          Ultimately, the gods decide to erase humanity with a flood.
        </p>

        <p>
          First of all, God didn’t create humanity to be used as a labor pool. On the contrary, humans are the high
          point of creation and are loved by God.</p>

        <p>
          God chooses the flood because of the deep moral problems that plague humanity. God’s purpose is to wash
          away the violence and bloodshed among humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although Earth is filled with corruption and violence, there’s one righteous man that is “blameless in his
          generation” (Gen 6:9), and God chooses Noah and his family to start over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noah after leaving the Ark makes a sacrifice to God, and this sacrifice is well received (Gen 8:20). Then,
          we get a preview of the covenant God will make with Noah: no more destruction. God chooses mercy over
          judgment, even in light of human sinfulness and the effects of original sin: “for the imagination of man’s
          heart is evil from his youth” (Gen 9:21).
        </p>

        <p>
          In Genesis 9, the story of <i>re-creation</i> continues, with a lot of similarities with The Creation
          story. God blesses Noah’s family and tells them to be fruitful and multiply (Gen 9:2).
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, God establishes his covenant with Noah (Gen 9:1-11), the second covenant God makes with humanity. It
          first establishes some new permissions (like eating animals) and some rules, with the most important one being
          not killing (Gen 9:5-6).
        </p>

        <p>
          Again, it is demonstrated where human dignity comes from: every human is made in the image and likeness of
          God (Gen 9:6), and because of that, human life is sacred and worthy of respect and dignity.
        </p>

        <p>
          After establishing the new rules, God makes the promise of the covenant, that he will preserve humanity and
          the waters will never become flood to destroy all flesh again (Gen 9:11). The rainbow is the sign of covenant,
          the visible sign of God’s bow in the clouds (Gen 9:13–5), which also demonstrates that God will not use his
          “bow” to destroy life on earth.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the establishment of the covenant, the re-creation story continues. Now, in a tragic twist, the Fall
          again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noah takes the fruit (similarly Gen 3:6) from the vineyard and drank the wine, becoming drunk (sin of
          intemperance; gluttony) and lays naked (similarly Gen 3:7) in his tent (Gen 9:20-21).
        </p>

        <p>
          Right after, a tragedy happens:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.” -
          Genesis 9:22
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Now to the mindblowing part. With no further context, it’s difficult to understand what wrong did Ham
          do here, why would seeing his father naked (maybe even accidentally) be so terrible for Noah to curse Ham’s
          unborn son (Canaan)? (Gen 9:25)
        </p>

        <p>
          But seeing or uncovering “the nakedness of his father” is an idiomatic expression for <i>sleeping with his
            father’s wife</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This become clearer when we see the same expression being used in Leviticus:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>“The man who lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall be
              put to death, their blood is upon them.”</i> - Leviticus 20:11</li>
          <li>“<i>None of you shall approach any one near of kin to him to uncover nakedness. I am the Lord.”</i> -
            Leviticus 18:6</li>
          <li>“<i>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is the nakedness of your mother; she is your
              mother, you shall not uncover her nakedness.</i>” - Leviticus 18:7</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And this was not just an act of lust, it was probably an act of rebellion, and attempt of domination and
          humiliation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Noah was the leader of the family, and positions of authority such as kingship and priesthood usually
          passed down from father to the firstborn son. Ham may have been trying to steal the role of head of the family
          by dominating and humiliating his father.
        </p>

        <p>
          This attempt is congruent with other narratives inside and outside of the Bible that follow a similar
          template:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Greek mythology where one god usurps power and legitimizes his rule by sleeping with the previous god’s
            wives. </li>
          <li>
            Absalom, King David’s son, sleeps with David’s concubines to solidify his claim to the throne
            (2 Sm 16:21-22).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Knowing what happened, Noah’s other sons, Shem and Japheth, honored their father and mother and covered
          their mother, without looking at her (Gen 9:23).
        </p>

        <p>
          This explanation also sheds light on why Noah curses Canaan. Why curse an unborn son of Ham? And why this
          one instead of another one?
        </p>

        <p>
          Because Canaan is the fruit of the rape and incest Ham did. (But why not curse Ham instead? Some say it is
          because God had already blessed Ham, so Noah couldn’t curse him)
        </p>

        <p>
          This also explains why Canaan is mentioned in the chapter, two times, actually. The first in the beginning
          of the story (Gen 9:18), and the other right when the “uncovering of the nakedness” (i.e. the rape and incest)
          occurs (Gen 9:22).
        </p>

        <p>
          The explanation of what happened also makes sense in the broader context on what will happen in the
          following chapters. Canaan is the ascendant of several tribes and nations that collectively are known as the
          Canaanites, which inhabit the region of Canaan.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Canaanites are known for their sexual immorality and perversity, and the rules against incest given in
          Leviticus 18:6-7 are the first rules (and warnings) God gives to the Israelites before they enter the land of
          Canaan (Lv 18:1-5).
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet again, as seen with the Creation story, we see how sin leads to the breaking of families and leads to a
          cycle that leaves humanity in a bad shape with great moral depravity.
        </p>

        <p>
          But there might be hope. Shem, Noah’s faithful and honoring firstborn is blessed (Gen 9:26) by Noah.
