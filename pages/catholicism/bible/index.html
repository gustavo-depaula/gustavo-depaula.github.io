            I'm reading the Bible with the help of the amazing
            <a
              href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/"
              >"Bible In A Year"</a
            >
            podcast by the incredible Fr. Mike Schmitz. He reads the Sacred
            Scriptures not in the order of the books, but divided in a way where
            passages of multiple books are read each day in a way that the
            readings are in-context, making the narrative easier to follow.
          </p>

          <p>
            There's also the book
            <a href="https://ascensionpress.com/"
              >"Walking with God: A Journey Through the Bible"</a
            >
            by Tim Gray and Jeff Cavins, which follows the same timeline. The
            podcast uses the Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition. I read
            it through the Ascension Press app.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although the idea is to listen/read day-by-day so you can finish in
            a year, I fail miserably at that goal üòÖ. Both because of lack of
            discipline and want/need to read multiple times the same passages so
            I can understand better what's bein said, because there is so much
            to learn and so many layers of meaning.
          </p>

          <p>
            These are my notes, thoughts, interpretations and questions about
            the Bible. I'm a layman and recent convert, not a theologian, so
            take this as an amateur's <em>exegesis</em>.

            If you hover over the Bible references, you'll see the text of the

          <h1>Day 1 - Creation</h1>
          <h2>Genesis 1 & 2; Psalm 19</h2>

          <p>
            The creation story of genesis is unique among creation stories
            because all other stories involve a god or gods creating the world
            out of violence, destruction, sex or desire for having slaves to do
            the work or entertain them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Differently, the Hebrew word used in Genesis to talk about the
            creation is <em>‚ÄúBara‚Äù</em>, which means create out of nothing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Why did God create us?</b> <br />
            To share in his perfect and good divine nature,
            <b>‚Äúto share in his blessed life‚Äù</b> as the Catechism puts it. We
            do that by <b>labor</b> (working as God has worked to create us),
            <b>leisure</b> (as God rested after work), and <b>love</b> (as God
            loves us and is infinite love).
          </p>
          <p>
            Genesis also establishes where we get our dignity from. It is not
            from our strength, power, beauty, wisdom or a government. We get our
            dignity from the fact that every human being - male and female - is
            made in God‚Äôs image and likeness.
          </p>

          <p>
            A little poem about the creation of Eve and male/female equality in
            dignity:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            ‚ÄúWhen God took Eve from Adam,<br />
            He did not take her from his head to Lord over him,<br />
            Nor from his foot to be walked upon by him.<br />
            He took her from his side, to walk with him;<br />
            From beneath his arms to be guarded by him;<br />
            And from near his heart to be loved by him.‚Äù<br />
          </blockquote>
          <p>‚ÄîA little bit cheesy, but I like it!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="bible-day">
          <h1>Day 2 - The Fall</h1>
          <h2>Genesis 3 & 4; Psalm 104</h2>

          <p>
            The snake doesn‚Äôt dismiss God‚Äôs existence or even his authority. The
            snake questions the Lord‚Äôs trustworthiness.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sin is the fallacy that we can make our own moral rules, different
            from the divine objective moral law.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are limited and fallible beings, without the capacity of fully
            understanding the consequences of our actions. When we try to
            deviate from objective morality made by the perfect and infinitely
            good God, we are inviting suffering into our lives.
          </p>

          <p>
            The challenge is not whether you believe in God. It is if you belong
            to him, or will you make yourself your own god. You belong to God
            when you obey him because you know He loves you.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pain and suffering of Adam and Eve are not curses. They are
            remedies. Because they failed to choose love, they have to learn
            that love always involves sacrifice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Love requires sacrifice. For Eve to love her husband and bring forth
            a family, she‚Äôll have to endure a lot of pain in childbearing. For
            Adam to love his wife and his family, to protect and provide for
            them, he will have to endure physical pain of labor. In these ways,
            they will learn that to love requires sacrifice.
          </p>

          <p>
            How do we know God is not just punishing them? Because he guards the
            tree of life (Gen 3:22) and clothed them (Gen 3:21).
          </p>

          <p>
            He guards the tree of life because if they eat the fruit of the tree
            of life, they will live forever. And God seeing their brokenness in
            that state, can‚Äôt allow they living forever that way.
          </p>

          <p>
            God clothing them is the sign that even in this state of sin, God
            still cares for them and continues to provide for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            God clothes them in leather skins (Gen 3:21), which means that
            something had to die for God to love them. Again, this connection
            between love and sacrifice.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the Fall, things escalate quickly, with fratricide happening
            (Gen 4:8) soon after. Again demonstrating how disastrous the
            consequences of our sins can be.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why Abel‚Äôs offering was accepted, but Cain‚Äôs not? It is unknowable,
            but one hypothesis would be that Abel offered the ‚Äúfirst fruits‚Äù
            (Gen 4:4), while Cain offered ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù.
          </p>

          <p>
            Love requires sacrifice, and to love God we also need to sacrifice
            something. This is clear when we pray: we are sacrificing our time
            to love God.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we pray are we offering our best time, our ‚Äúfirst fruits‚Äù? Or
            are we just offering ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù, what‚Äôs left in our day, thus making
            our sacrifice meaningless?
          </p>

          <p>
            But God, in his infinite mercy, will forgive our bad offerings and
            accept us again if we do good (Gen 4:7). And even with all the
            temptation, we do not have to sin. Not only that, but we need to
            learn how to control ourselves, master our emotions and choose to
            not to sin.
          </p>

          <p>Questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Did God lie? Because they didn‚Äôt die when they ate the fruit.
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Their death was spiritual. They committed a mortal sin, losing
                their holiness and separating themselves from God.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <li>
              Why God says that Adam and Eve have become like them? (Gen 3:22)
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Before eating the fruit, Adam and Eve had a childlike innocence,
                and after eating they gained a knowledge about good and evil,
                which made them more similar to God in this aspect. But this
                came at the cost of the loss of innocence and the introduction
                of sin into their lives.
              </li>
              <li>
                It could also be a somewhat ironic statement. In their quest to
                become like God, they separated themselves further away from
                God, achieving the opposite consequence and bringing brokenness
                into their lives.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Who is Cain‚Äôs wife?</li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                It seems that there were other humans, because incest is
                contrary to natural law.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can‚Äôt be other humans because all humans are descendants of
                Adam and Eve. Furthermore, if there were other humans, they
                wouldn‚Äôt be stained by the original sin.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thus, it has to be that Cain‚Äôs wife was a sister or niece or
                grandniece. And that, by some unknown factor, incest was not a
                biological or moral problem in that specific circumstance.
              </li>

          <p>
            When Seth‚Äôs line is presented, it is presented by first pointing out
            that Seth was made in the image and likeness of Adam (alluding to
            the passage that Adam was made in the image and likeness of God).
          </p>

          <p>
            Seth‚Äôs line has righteous men like Enoch, that ‚Äúwalked with God‚Äù
            (Gen 5:24) and Noah, the one that ‚Äúshall bring us relief from our
            work and from the toil of our hands.‚Äù (Gen 5:29).
          </p>

          <p>
            When Cain‚Äôs line is presented, we are presented with Lamech, a
            polygamist (Gen 4:19) and murderer (Gen 4:23).
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>
              And why does Lamech says ‚ÄúIf Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly
              Lamech seventy-sevenfold.‚Äù (Gen 4:24)?
            </b>
          </p>

          <p>
            He is referring to the promise God made to protect Cain in Gen 4:15,
            but God put the mark in Cain and not on his descendants as well.
            Thus, this is a claim Lamech is making himself. This seems to
            describe a progression on the effects of sin of the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The greater degree of vengeance might describe a progression of
            violence (with the crime committed being worse), a culture of
            retribution or Lamech‚Äôs bragging about his dominance, which
            emphasizes his and society‚Äôs moral decay.
          </p>

          <p><b>Who are the sons of God and daughters of men?</b></p>

          <p>
            Given the clear distinction of the Seth‚Äôs and Cain‚Äôs line
            previously, it would make sense that ‚Äúsons of God‚Äù refers to the
            Seth‚Äôs line, specially giving the description that Seth was made in
            the image and likeness of Adam. Thus the daughters of men would be
            the Cain‚Äôs line.
          </p>

          <p>
            If this interpretation is correct, the story seems to be about the
            progressive degradation of the ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù line, with the
            intermarriage symbolizing the adoption of morally evil practices of
            the other line, one of them polygamy (Gen 6:2), which is previously
            associated with violence (Lamech‚Äôs narrative).
          </p>

          <p>
            Earth is now fully corrupted and full of violence (Gen 6:11-12). But
            in amidst all this chaos, there is one righteous man, Noah, that
            walks with God, and is blameless in his generation (Gen 6:9).

        <section class="bible-day">
          <h1>Day 4 - The Flood</h1>
          <h2>Genesis 7, 8, & 9; Psalm 1</h2>

          <p>
            The flood and Noah‚Äôs ark is one the best-known narratives in the
            Bible. What usually is not known is that there are many other flood
            narratives that were written in the region of Ancient Mesopotamia.
            But similarly to the creation story, the Bible‚Äôs Flood narrative is
            unique.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the Babylonian story, known as Antra-Hasis, gods make humans to
            be used as labor force, and when these humans start to overpopulate
            earth, the gods decide to send plagues and famines to control the
            population. Ultimately, the gods decide to erase humanity with a
            flood.
          </p>

          <p>
            First of all, God didn‚Äôt create humanity to be used as a labor pool.
            On the contrary, humans are the high point of creation and are loved
            by God.
          </p>

          <p>
            God chooses the flood because of the deep moral problems that plague
            humanity. God‚Äôs purpose is to wash away the violence and bloodshed
            among humanity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although Earth is filled with corruption and violence, there‚Äôs one
            righteous man that is ‚Äúblameless in his generation‚Äù (Gen 6:9), and
            God chooses Noah and his family to start over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Noah after leaving the Ark makes a sacrifice to God, and this
            sacrifice is well received (Gen 8:20). Then, we get a preview of the
            covenant God will make with Noah: no more destruction. God chooses
            mercy over judgment, even in light of human sinfulness and the
            effects of original sin: ‚Äúfor the imagination of man‚Äôs heart is evil
            from his youth‚Äù (Gen 9:21).
          </p>

          <p>
            In Genesis 9, the story of <i>re-creation</i> continues, with a lot
            of similarities with The Creation story. God blesses Noah‚Äôs family
            and tells them to be fruitful and multiply (Gen 9:2).
          </p>

          <p>
            Then, God establishes his covenant with Noah (Gen 9:1-11), the
            second covenant God makes with humanity. It first establishes some
            new permissions (like eating animals) and some rules, with the most
            important one being not killing (Gen 9:5-6).
          </p>

          <p>
            Again, it is demonstrated where human dignity comes from: every
            human is made in the image and likeness of God (Gen 9:6), and
            because of that, human life is sacred and worthy of respect and
            dignity.
          </p>

          <p>
            After establishing the new rules, God makes the promise of the
            covenant, that he will preserve humanity and the waters will never
            become flood to destroy all flesh again (Gen 9:11). The rainbow is
            the sign of covenant, the visible sign of God‚Äôs bow in the clouds
            (Gen 9:13‚Äì5), which also demonstrates that God will not use his
            ‚Äúbow‚Äù to destroy life on earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the establishment of the covenant, the re-creation story
            continues. Now, in a tragic twist, the Fall again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Noah takes the fruit (similarly Gen 3:6) from the vineyard and drank
            the wine, becoming drunk (sin of intemperance; gluttony) and lays
            naked (similarly Gen 3:7) in his tent (Gen 9:20-21).
          </p>

          <p>Right after, a tragedy happens:</p>
          <blockquote>
            ‚ÄúAnd Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and
            told his two brothers outside.‚Äù - Genesis 9:22
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Now to the mindblowing part. With no further context, it‚Äôs difficult
            to understand what wrong did Ham do here, why would seeing his
            father naked (maybe even accidentally) be so terrible for Noah to
            curse Ham‚Äôs unborn son (Canaan)? (Gen 9:25)
          </p>

          <p>
            But seeing or uncovering ‚Äúthe nakedness of his father‚Äù is an
            idiomatic expression for <i>sleeping with his father‚Äôs wife</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            This become clearer when we see the same expression being used in
            Leviticus:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <i
                >‚ÄúThe man who lies with his father‚Äôs wife has uncovered his
                father‚Äôs nakedness; both of them shall be put to death, their
                blood is upon them.‚Äù</i
              >
              - Leviticus 20:11
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Äú<i
                >None of you shall approach any one near of kin to him to
                uncover nakedness. I am the Lord.‚Äù</i
              >
              - Leviticus 18:6
            </li>
            <li>
              ‚Äú<i
                >You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, which is
                the nakedness of your mother; she is your mother, you shall not
                uncover her nakedness.</i
              >‚Äù - Leviticus 18:7
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            And this was not just an act of lust, it was probably an act of
            rebellion, and attempt of domination and humiliation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Noah was the leader of the family, and positions of authority such
            as kingship and priesthood usually passed down from father to the
            firstborn son. Ham may have been trying to steal the role of head of
            the family by dominating and humiliating his father.
          </p>

          <p>
            This attempt is congruent with other narratives inside and outside
            of the Bible that follow a similar template:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Greek mythology where one god usurps power and legitimizes his
              rule by sleeping with the previous god‚Äôs wives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Absalom, King David‚Äôs son, sleeps with David‚Äôs concubines to
              solidify his claim to the throne (2 Sm 16:21-22).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Knowing what happened, Noah‚Äôs other sons, Shem and Japheth, honored
            their father and mother and covered their mother, without looking at
            her (Gen 9:23).
          </p>

          <p>
            This explanation also sheds light on why Noah curses Canaan. Why
            curse an unborn son of Ham? And why this one instead of another one?
          </p>

          <p>
            Because Canaan is the fruit of the rape and incest Ham did. (But why
            not curse Ham instead? Some say it is because God had already
            blessed Ham, so Noah couldn‚Äôt curse him)
          </p>

          <p>
            This also explains why Canaan is mentioned in the chapter, two
            times, actually. The first in the beginning of the story (Gen 9:18),
            and the other right when the ‚Äúuncovering of the nakedness‚Äù (i.e. the
            rape and incest) occurs (Gen 9:22).
          </p>

          <p>
            The explanation of what happened also makes sense in the broader
            context on what will happen in the following chapters. Canaan is the
            ascendant of several tribes and nations that collectively are known
            as the Canaanites, which inhabit the region of Canaan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Canaanites are known for their sexual immorality and perversity,
            and the rules against incest given in Leviticus 18:6-7 are the first
            rules (and warnings) God gives to the Israelites before they enter
            the land of Canaan (Lv 18:1-5).
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet again, as seen with the Creation story, we see how sin leads to
            the breaking of families and leads to a cycle that leaves humanity
            in a bad shape with great moral depravity.
          </p>

          <p>
            But there might be hope. Shem, Noah‚Äôs faithful and honoring
            firstborn is blessed (Gen 9:26) by Noah.

          <h1>Day 5 - Tower of Babel</h1>
          <h2>Genesis 10-11; Psalm 2</h2>

          <p>
            Genesis 10-11 are narratives that tell the story of how nations and
            languages in earth came to be. In Genesis 10, we have a long
            genealogy of the sons of Noah. As seen with the genealogy of Adam
            &amp Eve, the genealogy of the sons of Noah allows us to keep track
            on what nations and people are faithful to God (Shem‚Äôs line) and the
            wicked ones (Ham‚Äôs line).
          </p>

          <p>
            From Ham‚Äôs line, we have the descendants of Canaan: the Canaanites,
            Amorites and Jebusites, which will oppose Israel conquer of the
            Promised Land. Apart from Canaan, there are also other descendants
            of Ham, which includes Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, which will become
            places for slavery and exile of the Israeli people. In summary,
            Ham‚Äôs descendants are the traditional enemies of Israel.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Genesis 11, we get the story of the Tower of Babel. Babel is
            ancient Babylon. Historically, the Tower of Babel might be a tower
            offered to other gods. The name Babel is associated with the
            Akkadian (language spoken in ancient Babylon) word ‚ÄúBab-ilu‚Äù, which
            means ‚ÄúGate of God‚Äù. The word Babel, in hebrew, is also associated
            in the text with the verb ‚Äúbalal‚Äù which means ‚Äúto confuse‚Äù, which
            later on is important when God <i>confused</i> their languages.
            Already in the language there is this tension: for the humans, it‚Äôs
            the "Gate of God", for God, <i>it‚Äôs just confusion</i>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The main building project of the city of Babel was the Tower of
            Babel, a tower that they intended to be so big it reached its top in
            Heaven (Gen 11:4). The city at this time was led by Nimrod, one of
            Ham‚Äôs descendants described as ‚Äúthe first on earth to be a mighty
            man‚Äù (Gen 10:8). He founded Babel as the start of his kingdom (Gen
            10:10).
          </p>

          <p>
            Until now, we have seen how sin creates division, but now we can see
            how sin can unite people. A unity in idolatry and pride, that puts
            men and worldly affairs in the center of worship.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Tower of Babel, with its intended ‚Äútop in heaven‚Äù can be seen as
            a attempt at a forced entry into heaven or to create an artificial
            heaven-on-earth based on strength, power, and wealth.
          </p>

          <p>
            The quest to be great and do great things is not a bad thing ‚Äî after
            all, there is a universal call to holiness (CCC 2013) and to do
            great works. The problem with the builders of the Tower of Babel had
            a disordered ambition. The construction of the tower was a
            purposeful act of rebellion against God and his commandments.
          </p>

          <p>
            In both covenants God made with humans, he gave the commandment of
            "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth" (with Adam &amp Eve:
            Gen 1:28; with Noah: Gen 9:1). The builders of the tower directly
            challenged this commandment when they built the tower to
            <b>not</b> fill the earth: ‚Äúlest we be scattered abroad upon the
            face of the whole earth‚Äù (Gen 11:4).
          </p>

          <p>
            It is also said the they wanted the tower with its top in heavens to
            ‚Äúmake a name for themselves‚Äù (Gen 11:4). This signals an intention
            to achieve divine status through wealth and power. Similarly, the
            snake offered to Adam &amp Eve the allure of divine status through
            knowledge (Gen 3:5).
          </p>

          <p>
            Also, the word ‚Äúname‚Äù in Hebrew is ‚Äúshem‚Äù, which is also the name of
            Noah‚Äôs firstborn (Shem) that received the family blessing, passing
            down family authority, which included kingship and priesthood. By
            ‚Äúmaking a [shem] for themselves‚Äù, they‚Äôre rebelling against rightful
            authority they weren‚Äôt entitled to, just like Ham did.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Tower of Babel narrative is preceded and succeeded by the
            genealogy of Shem. This narrative of Nimrod and the Babel people
            trying to make a ‚Äúshem‚Äù for themselves "sandwhiched" by the
            genealogy of the real Shem tells us that they weren‚Äôt successful in
            doing so. Indeed, the Shemites (or Semites) will continue to hold
            the rightful authority and will be the ones that will bring forth
            the great patriarchs and eventually, the Messiah.
          </p>

          <p>
            Further on, God comes <b>down</b> to see the city and the tower (Gen
            11:5). This not just a description that God is in Heaven and needs
            to come down to earth. This mocks the rebellious people attempt to
            force their way to heaven, as it was so futile that God needs to
            "come down" to even "see" what they‚Äôre attempting. Once again, God
            intervenes in their wickedness, judging Babel by confusing people‚Äôs
            language. Their sin and rebellion have resulted in further division
            and exile.
          </p>

          <p>
            All-in-all, the Tower of Babel tells a narrative on the power and
            potential of human unity and cooperation, but it highlights the
            tendency of pride and self-glorification.
          </p>

          <p>Questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Was everyone at Babel under the kingdom of Nimrod when this
              narrative happened?
            </li>
            <li>Why does God says:</li>

              <li>
                "they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of
                what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now
                be impossible for them" (Gen 11:6)

              <li>Maybe signals human potential when united.</li>

              <li>‚Äúlet us go down‚Äù (Gen 11:7)</li>
              <li>
                Why the first person in the plural (‚Äòus‚Äô)? Maybe trinitarian
                explanation (the three persons of the trinity)?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <div class="divider" />

          <p>
            A friend of mine asked on what is the ‚ÄòCatholic interpretation of
            the Tower of Babel‚Äô, and it would be nice to write some words about
            it. The Catholic Church does not teach the necessity of a literal
            interpretation of the events in Genesis. There are those who hold to
            a more traditional view, interpreting the stories from Genesis as
            strict literal history like we write today, but I would most
            theologians today hold a more symbolic interpretation of the
            narratives told here.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many catholic biblical scholars use the historical-critical method,
            which uses historical context, literary forms, and intended messages
            of the biblical texts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nonetheless, everything in Sacred Scripture is true and holds
            profound significance. But we should be mindful that the people that
            originally wrote these histories had a very different understanding
            of how history should be recorded and transmitted.
          </p>

          <p>The Catechism of the Catholic Church says:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <u>109</u> In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way.
              To interpret Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to
              what the human authors truly wanted to affirm, and to what God
              wanted to reveal to us by their words.
            </p>
            <p>
              <u>110</u> In order to discover the sacred authors' intention, the
              reader must take into account the conditions of their time and
              culture, the literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of
              feeling, speaking and narrating then current. "For the fact is
              that truth is differently presented and expressed in the various
              types of historical writing, in prophetical and poetical texts,
              and in other forms of literary expression."
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Thus, it is important to understand that Sacred Scripture is
            God-inspired and conveys important spiritual and moral truths.
            Sacred Scripture includes a wide range of literary genres such as
            historical narratives, poetry, prophecy and laws. Therefore, the
            truths conveyed in Scripture can include historical facts,
            theological insights, moral teachings, and spiritual meanings, all
            of which must be understood in the context of the literary forms and
            cultural context of the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike what muslims believe about the Quran, we don‚Äôt believe that
            every word was written directly by God. Sacred Scripture is inspired
            by God, but written by humans, and humans from different times and
            eras. And we should strive to understand the truths that these
            humans are transmitting, and not judging the texts like 21st century
            historical pieces.

            The readings of the day introduce us to interesting people. In
            Genesis, we enter the patriarch era, where we are introduced to
            Abram and Sa‚Äôrai (which will become the patriarch Abraham and his
            wife Sara) and, in the Book of Job, Job himself. We are also
            introduced to the Book of Proverbs.
          </p>

          <h3>Commentary on Genesis:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              God sends Abram to a new land and makes him three promises:
              through Abram, God will make a (1) great nation, (2) a great name,
              (3) and all the families of the earth will be blessed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abram does as God said, and with his wife Sar‚Äôai and his nephew
              Lot, starts his journey. When Abram is in Canaan, he makes an
              altar to the Lord, and He promises to give this land to him.
            </li>
            <li>
              Because of a famine in the land of Canaan, Abram is forced to go
              to Egypt. But, he is worried that the Egyptians will kill him to
              take his wife, as Sar‚Äôai is a very beautiful woman. Thus, he says
              to the Egyptians that Sar‚Äôai is his sister.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Egyptians see Sar‚Äôai, and the Pharaoh makes Sar‚Äôai his wife
              and takes her into his home. Because of her, the Pharaoh gives
              Abram many riches, including animals and servants.

            <li>
              God afflicts the Pharaoh with plagues because of Sar‚Äôai, leading
              the Pharaoh to return Abram his wife, and sending him on his way
              out of Egypt with all his newly acquired possessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abram and Lot return to Canaan, to the same place where he had
              built the altar.
            </li>
            <li>
              But now they had so many possessions, so many animals, that the
              land couldn‚Äôt support both of them together, thus they need to
              move apart from each other.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abram lets Lot choose where he wants to be, and Lot chooses to be
              near the city of Sodom, and the people of Sodom were ‚Äúwicked‚Äù,
              great sinners.
            </li>
            <li>
              God reiterates the promise to Abram that He will give him all this
              land. This is part of the larger promise of making a great nation.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The elephant in the room: What? Did Abram really got ‚Äúcucked‚Äù by the
            Pharaoh? Not only the Pharaoh took Sar‚Äôai as his wife, this was
            planned by Abram?
          </p>

          <p>
            I won‚Äôt go here on the historicity of the patriarchs‚Äô story, but one
            thing that strikes me deeply is how different these stories are from
            what one would expect a creation myth to be. Instead of a flawless
            hero, we have an imperfect man like Abram. Instead of assertions
            that this land was always an Israelite land and thus they can claim
            that land, the narrative tells us that there are already other
            people living there, and that God will give this land to Abram.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even with God‚Äôs promise, Abram doesn‚Äôt trust that God will care for
            him when he enters Egypt. He sins by not trusting the Divine
            Providence and his sin leads to brokenness in his family (the
            Pharaoh taking his wife). And it seems that he also shouldn‚Äôt have
            brought Lot to the journey, as God asks him to leave his country and
            kindred (family).
          </p>

          <p>
            But Abram was faithful to God in leaving his original land and
            country and not even knowing where he was going to. He also is
            faithful in prayer by building an altar and making sacrifices. He
            also trusts in the providence when he says to Lot that he can choose
            the land that Lot thinks it‚Äôs best, knowing that wherever he is, God
            will take care of him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lot sees that the Jordan valley is a fertile region and moves in the
            direction of Sodom, a city of ‚Äúgreat sinners‚Äù. Gen 13:10 says that
            the Jordan valley was well watered like the ‚Äúgarden of the LORD‚Äù. I
            think this is reference to The Fall, with the garden of the Lord
            being a reference to Eden. Lot goes towards a place of sin (Sodom)
            because of attractive features he sees in that region. Similarly to
            how Eve sees attractive features in the forbidden fruit (Gen 3:6).
          </p>

          <p>Questions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If the Pharaoh know that God existed and His power, why did he and
              the Egyptians worshipped false gods?

          <h3>Commentary on the Book of Job:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Job is a blameless, righteous, and really wealthy man. He has a
              big family and huge possessions and land. He always offered burnt
              offerings because his children may have sinned.
            </li>
            <li>
              Satan when talking to God, accuses Job of only being a good
              servant because of his material possessions. And Satan says that
              if God removes all of Job‚Äôs material possessions, Job will curse
              God.
            </li>
            <li>
              God allows Satan to remove everything from Job, but not touch him.
              Then, all of Job‚Äôs material possessions are destroyed, robbed, his
              servants killed and all of his children die in an accident.
            </li>
            <li>
              Job, in severe distress, worships God, and doesn‚Äôt curse God or
              sin.
            </li>
            <li>
              After failing, Satan comes back to God, saying that Job will curse
              Him if he bodily suffers. God allows Satan to continue, as long as
              Job continues alive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Job is afflicted with a severe skin disease, with constant pain,
              weight loss, cracking skin and severe itching.
            </li>
            <li>
              Job‚Äôs wife seeing his agony tells him to curse God, so that He may
              punish Job with death, which would be preferable to living in this
              situation. A sort of Euthanasia.
            </li>
            <li>Job denies his wife suggestions and does not sin.</li>
            <li>
              Job‚Äôs three friends, when they heard of what happened, go visit
              Job.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I have really enjoyed the Book of Job. It is mostly written as
            poetry, in a very elegant and well-written way. The author is
            unknown, but he certainly is a literary master. Reading it feels
            like watching a tragic theatrical piece, with some sprinkles of
            humor along the way. The Book of Job narrates a story around a deep
            philosophical question: Why innocent people suffer?
          </p>

          <p>
            This question is known in philosophy as the <b>problem of evil</b>.
            Why evil and suffering exist in a universe created by an
            all-powerful, all-knowing, good God? The premises of the Book of Job
            are perfect to explore this issue, because we know from the
            beginning that Job is completely blameless, he will indeed suffer
            without cause.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the question of historicity, it seems most scholars believe the
            Book of Job is mostly a didactic work, that explore abstract ideas
            and concepts in a concrete setting. Although it may have some
            historical basis, God interaction with ‚Äúthe Ardiversary‚Äù do not
            conform to what is expected from testimony of witnesses, and the
            dialogues between Job and his friends do not follow dynamics of
            spoken conversations.
          </p>

          <p>
            That said, again, I really like it, it is a pleasure to read it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Job is a righteous and blameless man, a servant of the Lord. He is a
            rich man, with a big family and a lot of material possessions.
            Without cause, Job suffers. The context of how this happens is a
            ‚Äúcontest‚Äù between God and ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù. ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù in Hebrew is a legal term
            for ‚ÄúAdversary‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccuser‚Äù. Satan is the one who will accuse Job
            of worshipping the God only for selfish reasons, challenging God‚Äôs
            knowledge of Job‚Äôs motives.
          </p>

          <p>
            In these series of contests, Satan will talk to God, accusing Job
            and trying to put him in a situation where he, the devil says, will
            turn against God. Job doesn‚Äôt turn against God in his suffering,
            though. In the following chapters, there will be dialogue between
            Job and his friends on why this is happening to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            One parallel I found interesting is how Satan tries to make Job sin
            through his wife (the suggestion of Euthanasia), just like the
            serpent made Adam sin through Eve (Gen 3:1-6).

          <h3>Commentary on Proverbs:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We are introduced to the what the book of proverbs is about: a
              collection of teachings of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel.
            </li>
            <li>Fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            To grow in wisdom is a spritual quest, and the bedrock of the
            spiritual life is faith, a theological virtue. Faith allows us to
            recognize what is virtuous and vicious, and move away from sin and
            towards a communion with God.
          </p>

          <p>
            St. Bede, in his <i>Commentary on Proverbs</i> differentiate between
            two types of ‚Äúfear‚Äù of the Lord:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Servile fear</b>: corrects the error of sins. It is a fear
              because you fear the punishment for your wrongdoings. It is
              related to ‚Äúimperfect contrition‚Äù when we sin and repent.
              <b>Replaced</b> by perfect love of God.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Holy fear</b>: the fear of a good son who is afraid to offend
              his loving father. Perfect love supplements this fear. It is
              related to ‚Äúperfect contrition‚Äù when we sin and repent.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <div class="divider" />

          <h3>Applications:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In our suffering, we should turn towards God, because He cares
              about us, will not abandon us, and will ultimately provide for us.
              But God will give what we need in the moment He judges is right.
              We must abandon our pride, persist in our prayers, and God will
              provide in the right moment, not in the moment that we want.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sin leads to brokenness. We must root out sin from our lives. We
              can only turn away from sin by strengthening our spiritual lives,
              acquiring wisdom and knowledge. And the basis of the spiritual
              lives is faith, and the fear of the Lord.

          <h1>Day 7 - God‚Äôs Covenant with Abram</h1>
          <h2>Genesis 14-15; Job 3-4; Proverbs 1:8-19;</h2>

          <h3>Commentary on Genesis 14:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The kings of Sodom, Gomor‚Äôrah, Admah, Zebo‚Äôim, Be‚Äôla (or Zo'ar)
              used to serve (were vassals to) Chedorlao'mer, the king of E‚Äôlam
              (in Mesopotamia), for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year,
              they rebelled.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chedorlao‚Äômer then builds an alliance with loyal kings from
              Shi‚Äônar, Ella‚Äôsar, and Goi‚Äôim to fight the rebellion. On their way
              to fight the five rebel kings, they subdue and plunder the
              kingdoms and people in-between.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rebel five kings join forces to fight Chedorlao‚Äômer‚Äôs forces
              in the Valley of Siddim. The rebels lose, and Chedorlao‚Äômer
              plunders the cities, taking their resources, and capturing Lot,
              who was living IN Sodom (as opposed to near Sodom as before), and
              his goods.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abram comes to know about Lot‚Äôs captivity and assembles a group of
              318 allied men to rescue him. Abram then pursues Chedorlao‚Äômer‚Äôs
              forces, and using "guerrilla‚Äô tactics, is able to rescue Lot and
              the spoils of people and property taken by the Mesopotamian
              armies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Melchiz‚Äôedek, king of Salem, priest, brings bread and wine and
              blesses Abram and blesses God for delivering the enemies into
              Abram‚Äôs hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abram pays tithe (a tenth of everything, "d√≠zimo") to
              Melchiz‚Äôedek.
            </li>
            <li>
              The king of Sodom offers all his properties to Abram, but he
              declines it, saying that he promised to God that he wouldn‚Äôt take
              anything that the king of Sodom has.
            </li>
          </ol>

          />

          <p>
            The first thing that pops into my mind is the Eucharistic reference
            in Melchizedek, a "priest of God Most High", bringing bread and wine
            (Gen 14:18), and blessing Abram and God. In the New Testament,
            Christ is described as a priest according to the order of
            Melchizedek (Heb 7).
          </p>

          <p>
            The tithe payed by Abram prefigures the Levitic law, where the other
            tribes have to pay a tenth of their earnings to the Levite tribe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Again, we see how sin leads to brokenness and destruction. Lot,
            decided to go towards Sodom, and ends up living inside it, a city of
            wicked man and great sinners (Gen 13:13). His actions leads to his
            captivity, which brings Abram to enter the war to save him. By
            Divine Providence (Gen 14:20), Abram is able to conquer the
            Mesopotamian forces and rescue the captured people and properties.
          </p>

          <h3>Commentary on Genesis 15:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              God appears to Abram in a vision and promises him, currently in an
              old age and childless, that he'll have many descendants, as many
              as stars in the sky. And Abram believes him.
            </li>
            <li>
              God asks Abram to bring some animals and he brings them and cut
              them in two.
            </li>
            <li>
              As the sun was going down, God says to Abram that his descendants
              will be slaves and oppressed in a land that it isn't theirs for
              400 years, but God will judge those nations and his descendants
              will have great possessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              After sunset, when it was dark, God, appearing as a fire pot and a
              flaming torch passes through the animals' pieces, making a
              covenant with Abram, that he will give the land to his
              descendants.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The process of passing through a hallway of splitten animals was the
            sign of making a Covenant in the old times. It signified that if
            someone broke the agreement, they can be broken like the animals
            they're passing through are. Interestingly, God is the one who
            passes through the covenant. Probably because He knew that Abram and
            his descendants would break the covenant many times.
          </p>

          <h3>Commentary on Job:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Job 3</b>: Upon severe distress, death seems preferable to
              life, as Job curses the day of his birth, saying that it would
              have been better to have died at birth or by miscarriage than
              living like this. He questions why his mother's knees and breasts
              "received" him. He sees death as a quiet place of rest where he'll
              be relieved of his sufferings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Job 4</b>: Eliphaz, one of Job's friends espouses the view that
              suffering is a result of sin.
            </li>
            <ol>
              <li>
                He says that Job, despite having instructed people in the past,
                now, when he is the one suffering, he is being impatient.
              </li>
              <li>
                Job's fear of God should be his confidence, and his integrity,
                his hope.
              </li>
              <li>
                No innocent person has ever perished, and those who sow trouble
                reap the same.
              </li>
              <li>
                No one is perfectly righteous before God, not even His Angels.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Curse in the text comes from the Hebrew word "revile" or "treat as
            worthless".

          <p>
            Eliphaz abides by the principle of retribution: where God will
            retribute people based on their behavior: if they sin, they suffer;
            if they are righteous, they reap good
            <b>material</b> rewards. Thus, according to Eliphaz, Job's current
            suffering is the result of (unrepented) sin.
          </p>

          <p>
            My guess is that Eliphaz will be proven wrong. Not all suffering is
            a result of sin. Suffering itself is a result of sin, and because we
            live in a broken and sinful world, we suffer. But not all individual
            suffering is the result of retribution of a committed sin.
          </p>

          <p>Here some proposed questions from the Bible I'm reading:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <b
                ><i>
                  Gen 3:1-10. In cursing the day of his birth‚Äîan event long
                  past‚Äîwhat is Job really cursing? Assuming that a curse is a
                  prayer that evil might befall someone or something, how likely
                  is it that God would answer such a prayer?
                </i></b
              >
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Job is cursing his life. Or, at least his own current state of
            affairs. I do think God is not likely to anwer a prayer to take away
            the life of someone, specially if it's their own life.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <b
                ><i>
                  Gen 3:11-13. What is the attraction of death among those who
                  entertain suicidal thoughts? How does Job's vision of death
                  compare with your own?
                </i></b
              >
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            I'm a little bit dyslexic, so I initially that it was asking how
            Job's suicidal thoughts compared to my own xD, and it hit right at
            home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having suffered from suicidal thoughts myself, Job conveys a similar
            feeling that I had: it's more about the desire of ending the
            suffering. Job envisions death as a peaceful, quiet sleep, where he
            will finally be able to rest. Job has a similar "line of thinking"
            that many in depression/suicidal episodes hold: I'm currently in
            pain; If I cease to exist, there won't be no pain; Thus, it is
            preferrable to cease to exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            I do think, though, that Eliphaz has a point. Faith (fear of God, as
            he describes it, Gen 4:6) in the Lord should be the cornerstone of
            our lives. And only through the supernatural virtue of faith, we can
            develop the other theologal virtues of charity (love) and hope. And
            a glimmer of hope, sometimes, is all we need to see, to believe that
            there's something better after this. And because I believe, I can
            pass through it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today I read about the life of
            <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoel_(m%C3%A1rtir)"
              >Saint Emmanuel</a
            >. He was a martyr of the fourth century. Because of his
            christianity, he refused to worship the Roman sun god, and the
            emperor ordered torture and death to him and his brothers.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Being the firstborn, Emmanuel was pierced with an iron nail in
              each shoulder, and another nail was driven through from ear to
              ear. Sharp splinters were also driven under the nails of his hands
              and feet. During the tortures, the brothers glorified God and
              prayed as if they did not feel pain. Finally, the Martyrs were
              beheaded, and Julian ordered that their bodies be burned
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            When I hear the martyrs' stories, I think about my own failings as a
            christian. These people endured tremendous suffering for their
            faith. They could just deny Christ, and they wouldn't go through all
            of this. But they didn't. They didn't betray Christ and His Church.
            Christianity is not a hippie religion, it is a deeply radical
            religion, and it shouldn't be easy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lord, please give me a faith like Saint Emmanuel had. Saint
            Emmanuel, pray for me.

            Fortunately, I have had only few cases. The first was a coworker's
            wife had a miscarriage, and he really wanted to be a father. He was
            extremely sad, crying, and it was visible the depths of despair of a
            father that had lost his child. I was sadden to know that that
            happened to him.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second was more indirect. I met a girl while travelling that
            told the story of how her best friend had an abortion because she
            accidently got pregnant from her boyfriend. She still lived with
            their parents and didn't told them.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was sad to hear the story. Perplexed at the naturality of the girl
            telling the story (she was from Switzerland, the law is probably
            more flexible than in Brazil). An internal outrage to hear that the
            coward boyfriend incentivized this, because he "wasn't ready to be a
            father". Screaming internally to him: "Be a man and grow up! This is
            your responsability, and you should deal with this like a man!".
          </p>

          <p>
            I myself was a product of an "accident", and I am extremely happy
            that my dad was not a coward, did not take the easy out, did not
            kill me, did not abandon me, and, on the contrary, raised me up as a
            single father. A real MAN. One of the characteristic I most value in
            a person, but especially in men, is the courage in trial times to
            raise up to their responsibility.

            The trial by words by St. Ambrose is that after losing all his
            belongings (including his family) and his own health, Job has to
            endure the harsh words of accusations of wrongdoing by his friends.
            And this is not easy, because harsh speech, especially when we're
            already distressed, is psychologically hard and hurtful, and poses a
            significant burden on the listener.

            It is true, but not necessarily in the retribution sense. It is
            clear that good and virtuous decisions help you in the future and
            sin and bad decisions lead to a path of brokeness. But there are
            always external factors we can't control.

          <h3>Commentary on Proverbs:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Always listen to the teaching of your father and mother.</li>
            <li>
              Be careful hanging around people that do habitual wrongdoings.

          <p>
            Proverbs 1:8-19 is a warning against peer pressure and the dangers
            of violence, and especially violence motivated by greed. The cure
            for this is to walk in the way of wisdom, by listening to the
            teachings of your father and mother, and avoiding the company of
            those who do evil.
