          I'm reading the Bible with the help of the amazing
          <a href="https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/">"Bible In A Year"</a>
          podcast by the incredible Fr. Mike Schmitz. He reads the Sacred
          Scriptures not in the order of the books, but divided in a way where
          passages of multiple books are read each day in a way that the
          readings are in-context, making the narrative easier to follow.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's also the book
          <a href="https://ascensionpress.com/">"Walking with God: A Journey Through the Bible"</a>
          by Tim Gray and Jeff Cavins, which follows the same timeline. The
          podcast uses the Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition. I read
          it through the Ascension Press app.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the idea is to listen/read day-by-day so you can finish in
          a year, I fail miserably at that goal üòÖ. Both because of lack of
          discipline and want/need to read multiple times the same passages so
          I can understand better what's bein said, because there is so much
          to learn and so many layers of meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          These are my notes, thoughts, interpretations and questions about
          the Bible. I'm a layman and recent convert, not a theologian, so
          take this as an amateur's <em>exegesis</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you hover over the Bible references, you'll see the text of the
          verse. If you click on it, you'll be taken to the Bible passage in
          <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">Bible Gateway</a>.

        <h1>Day 1 - Creation</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 1 & 2; Psalm 19</h2>

        <p>
          The creation story of genesis is unique among creation stories
          because all other stories involve a god or gods creating the world
          out of violence, destruction, sex or desire for having slaves to do
          the work or entertain them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Differently, the Hebrew word used in Genesis to talk about the
          creation is <em>‚ÄúBara‚Äù</em>, which means create out of nothing.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Why did God create us?</b> <br />
          To share in his perfect and good divine nature,
          <b>‚Äúto share in his blessed life‚Äù</b> as the Catechism puts it. We
          do that by <b>labor</b> (working as God has worked to create us),
          <b>leisure</b> (as God rested after work), and <b>love</b> (as God
          loves us and is infinite love).
        </p>
        <p>
          Genesis also establishes where we get our dignity from. It is not
          from our strength, power, beauty, wisdom or a government. We get our
          dignity from the fact that every human being - male and female - is
          made in God‚Äôs image and likeness.
        </p>

        <p>
          A little poem about the creation of Eve and male/female equality in
          dignity:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúWhen God took Eve from Adam,<br />
          He did not take her from his head to Lord over him,<br />
          Nor from his foot to be walked upon by him.<br />
          He took her from his side, to walk with him;<br />
          From beneath his arms to be guarded by him;<br />
          And from near his heart to be loved by him.‚Äù<br />
        </blockquote>
        <p>‚ÄîA little bit cheesy, but I like it!</p>
      </section>

      <section class="bible-day">
        <h1>Day 2 - The Fall</h1>
        <h2>Genesis 3 & 4; Psalm 104</h2>

        <p>
          The snake doesn‚Äôt dismiss God‚Äôs existence or even his authority. The
          snake questions the Lord‚Äôs trustworthiness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sin is the fallacy that we can make our own moral rules, different
          from the divine objective moral law.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are limited and fallible beings, without the capacity of fully
          understanding the consequences of our actions. When we try to
          deviate from objective morality made by the perfect and infinitely
          good God, we are inviting suffering into our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge is not whether you believe in God. It is if you belong
          to him, or will you make yourself your own god. You belong to God
          when you obey him because you know He loves you.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pain and suffering of Adam and Eve are not curses. They are
          remedies. Because they failed to choose love, they have to learn
          that love always involves sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Love requires sacrifice. For Eve to love her husband and bring forth
          a family, she‚Äôll have to endure a lot of pain in childbearing. For
          Adam to love his wife and his family, to protect and provide for
          them, he will have to endure physical pain of labor. In these ways,
          they will learn that to love requires sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          How do we know God is not just punishing them? Because he guards the
          tree of life (Gen 3:22) and clothed them (Gen 3:21).
        </p>

        <p>
          He guards the tree of life because if they eat the fruit of the tree
          of life, they will live forever. And God seeing their brokenness in
          that state, can‚Äôt allow they living forever that way.
        </p>

        <p>
          God clothing them is the sign that even in this state of sin, God
          still cares for them and continues to provide for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          God clothes them in leather skins (Gen 3:21), which means that
          something had to die for God to love them. Again, this connection
          between love and sacrifice.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the Fall, things escalate quickly, with fratricide happening
          (Gen 4:8) soon after. Again demonstrating how disastrous the
          consequences of our sins can be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why Abel‚Äôs offering was accepted, but Cain‚Äôs not? It is unknowable,
          but one hypothesis would be that Abel offered the ‚Äúfirst fruits‚Äù
          (Gen 4:4), while Cain offered ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù.
        </p>

        <p>
          Love requires sacrifice, and to love God we also need to sacrifice
          something. This is clear when we pray: we are sacrificing our time
          to love God.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we pray are we offering our best time, our ‚Äúfirst fruits‚Äù? Or
          are we just offering ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù, what‚Äôs left in our day, thus making
          our sacrifice meaningless?
        </p>

        <p>
          But God, in his infinite mercy, will forgive our bad offerings and
          accept us again if we do good (Gen 4:7). And even with all the
          temptation, we do not have to sin. Not only that, but we need to
          learn how to control ourselves, master our emotions and choose to
          not to sin.
        </p>

        <p>Questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Did God lie? Because they didn‚Äôt die when they ate the fruit.
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Their death was spiritual. They committed a mortal sin, losing
              their holiness and separating themselves from God.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>
            Why God says that Adam and Eve have become like them? (Gen 3:22)
          </li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Before eating the fruit, Adam and Eve had a childlike innocence,
              and after eating they gained a knowledge about good and evil,
              which made them more similar to God in this aspect. But this
              came at the cost of the loss of innocence and the introduction
              of sin into their lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              It could also be a somewhat ironic statement. In their quest to
              become like God, they separated themselves further away from
              God, achieving the opposite consequence and bringing brokenness
              into their lives.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <li>Who is Cain‚Äôs wife?</li>
          <ol>
            <li>
              It seems that there were other humans, because incest is
              contrary to natural law.
            </li>
            <li>
              It can‚Äôt be other humans because all humans are descendants of
              Adam and Eve. Furthermore, if there were other humans, they
              wouldn‚Äôt be stained by the original sin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thus, it has to be that Cain‚Äôs wife was a sister or niece or
              grandniece. And that, by some unknown factor, incest was not a
              biological or moral problem in that specific circumstance.
            </li>

            How the biblical flood story differs from other flood stories?
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Genesis chapter 4 and chapter 5 present two descendent lines of Adam
          & Eve. The Seth‚Äôs line and Cain‚Äôs line.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src="./images/bible-day-3-noah-genealogy.png" alt="Noah's Genealogy" />
          <figcaption>
            Noah's Genealogy, taken from
            <a
              href="https://christianity.stackexchange.com/questions/83778/was-noah-and-or-his-family-fully-or-partially-descendant-from-cain"><em>"Was
                Noah and/or his family fully or partially descendant
                from Cain?"</em></a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          When Seth‚Äôs line is presented, it is presented by first pointing out
          that Seth was made in the image and likeness of Adam (alluding to
          the passage that Adam was made in the image and likeness of God).
        </p>

        <p>
          Seth‚Äôs line has righteous men like Enoch, that ‚Äúwalked with God‚Äù
          (Gen 5:24) and Noah, the that ‚Äúshall bring us relief from our work
          and from the toil of our hands.‚Äù (Gen 5:29).
        </p>

        <p>
          When Cain‚Äôs line is presented, we are presented with Lamech, a
          polygamist (Gen 4:19) and murderer (Gen 4:23).
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>
            And why does Lamech says ‚ÄúIf Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly
            Lamech seventy-sevenfold.‚Äù (Gen 4:24)?
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          He is referring to the promise God made to protect Cain in Gen 4:15,
          but God put the mark in Cain and not on his descendants as well.
          Thus, this is a claim Lamech is making himself. This seems to
          describe a progression on the effects of sin of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          The greater degree of vengeance might describe a progression of
          violence (with the crime committed being worse), a culture of
          retribution or Lamech‚Äôs bragging about his dominance, which
          emphasizes his and society‚Äôs moral decay.
        </p>

        <p><b>Who are the sons of God and daughters of men?</b></p>

        <p>
          Given the clear distinction of the Seth‚Äôs and Cain‚Äôs line
          previously, it would make sense that ‚Äúsons of God‚Äù refers to the
          Seth‚Äôs line, specially giving the description that Seth was made in
          the image and likeness of Adam. Thus the daughters of men would be
          the Cain‚Äôs line.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this interpretation is correct, the story seems to be about the
          progressive degradation of the ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù line, with the
          intermarriage symbolizing the adoption of morally evil practices of
          the other line, one of them polygamy (Gen 6:2), which is previously
          associated with violence (Lamech‚Äôs narrative).
        </p>

        <p>
          Earth is now fully corrupted and full of violence (Gen 6:11-12). But
          in amidst all this chaos, there is one righteous man, Noah, that
          walks with God, and is blameless in his generation (Gen 6:9).
