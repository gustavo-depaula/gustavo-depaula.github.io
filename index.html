            I am building this site to share my ideas and talk about things that
            I like. It is under heavy construction!

          <h1>About me</h1>

          <p>
            I am a devout Roman Catholic ‚úù (c. 2024) that likes to solve
            problems and build new things by writing software and talking to
            people.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following is a port of the things in my old site. These will not
            be here for long, as I am planning on expanding and making new
            sections.

                Let's play chess:

                Here's my Github:

            <h3>Why do you use Comic Sans?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                Because it's the best font ever invented, for everything. And
                because I know nothing about typography.
              </p>

              <p>
                I also use it for coding and love it:
                <a href="https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font"
                  >https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font</a
                >
              </p>

              <p>
                Wholeheartedly recommend trying it. For me, it helped with me
                stopping misreading words and swapping letters/words.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's also an interesting side-effect. People tend to unfairly
                ridiculize Comic Sans. So the content you write on it needs to
                be really good to breakthrough this initial prejudice.

              <p>Yes. Yes. YES. Absolutely loved it.</p>

              <p>Here's a list of some of my favorite lines:</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  Hamilton doesn't hesitate <br />
                  He exhibits no restraint <br />
                  He takes and he takes and he takes <br />
                  And he keeps winning anyway <br />
                  He changes the game <br />
                  He plays and he raises the stakes <br />

                  Have I done enough?

            <h3>Where did you study?</h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                I did high school at the Technical School of the Federal
                University of Minas Gerais (Coltec-UFMG). There, I graduated in
                Technician in Systems Development. I'm grateful I had the
                opportunity to go there and glad I made the choice (one of the
                best I made in my life!).
