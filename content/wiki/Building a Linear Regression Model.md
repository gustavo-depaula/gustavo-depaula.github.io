Building a SLR model is about finding the coefficients for the equation mentioned in [[Regression Analysis#Linear Regression]].

Given a [[Quality metrics for estimators models|quality metric]] (examples will be using MSE), it's possible to find the best fit for a simple linear regression using two approaches.

## The mathematical approach
#unaswered 
There's an equation that does it, and it envolves also finding the slope of the line.

For multiple linear regression:
- Ordinary Least Squares
	- Takes long time for large datasets

## The optimization (engineering) approach

- Gradient Descent
