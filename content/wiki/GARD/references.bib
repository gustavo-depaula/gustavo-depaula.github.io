	abstract = {As the interest in autonomous systems continues to grow, one of the major challenges is collecting sufficient and representative real-world data. Despite the strong practical and commercial interest in autonomous landing systems in the aerospace field, there is a lack of open-source datasets of aerial images. To address this issue, we present a dataset-lard-of high-quality aerial images for the task of runway detection during approach and landing phases. Most of the dataset is composed of synthetic images but we also provide manually labelled images from real landing footages, to extend the detection task to a more realistic setting. In addition, we offer the generator which can produce such synthetic front-view images and enables automatic annotation of the runway corners through geometric transformations. This dataset paves the way for further research such as the analysis of dataset quality or the development of models to cope with the detection tasks.

	abstract = {Airport runway segmentation can effectively reduce the accident rate during the landing phase, which has the largest risk of flight accidents. With the rapid development of deep learning (DL), related methods achieve good performance on segmentation tasks and can be well adapted to complex scenes. However, the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets in this field makes the development of methods based on DL difficult. Therefore, we propose a benchmark for airport runway segmentation, named BARS. Additionally, a semiautomatic annotation pipeline is designed to reduce the annotation workload. BARS has the largest dataset with the richest categories and the only instance annotation in the field. The dataset, which was collected using the X-Plane simulation platform, contains 10,256 images and 30,201 instances with three categories. We evaluate eleven representative instance segmentation methods on BARS and analyze their performance. Based on the characteristic of an airport runway with a regular shape, we propose a plug-and-play smoothing postprocessing module (SPM) and a contour point constraint loss (CPCL) function to smooth segmentation results for mask-based and contour-based methods, respectively. Furthermore, a novel evaluation metric named average smoothness (AS) is developed to measure smoothness. The experiments show that existing instance segmentation methods can achieve prediction results with good performance on BARS. SPM and CPCL can effectively enhance the AS metric while modestly improving accuracy. Our work will be available at https://github.com/c-wenhui/BARS.},

	abstract = {Visual navigation, characterized by its autonomous capabilities, cost effectiveness, and robust resistance to interference, serves as the foundation for vision-based autonomous landing systems. These systems rely heavily on runway instance segmentation, which accurately divides runway areas and provides precise information for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation. However, current research primarily focuses on runway detection but lacks relevant runway instance segmentation datasets. To address this research gap, we created the Runway Landing Dataset (RLD), a benchmark dataset that focuses on runway instance segmentation mainly based on X-Plane. To overcome the challenges of large-scale changes and input image angle differences in runway instance segmentation tasks, we propose a vision-based autonomous landing segmentation network (VALNet) that uses band-pass filters, where a Context Enhancement Module (CEM) guides the model to learn adaptive “band” information through heatmaps, while an Orientation Adaptation Module (OAM) of a triple-channel architecture to fully utilize rotation information enhances the model’s ability to capture input image rotation transformations. Extensive experiments on RLD demonstrate that the new method has significantly improved performance. The visualization results further confirm the effectiveness and interpretability of VALNet in the face of large-scale changes and angle differences. This research not only advances the development of runway instance segmentation but also highlights the potential application value of VALNet in vision-based autonomous landing systems. Additionally, RLD is publicly available.},

Due to lack of efficient systems, there have been numerous landing accidents resulting in the damage of onboard hardware. Vision based systems provides low cost solution to detect landing sites by providing rich textual information. To this end, this research focuses on accurate detection and localization of runways in aerial images with untidy terrains which would consequently help aerial platforms especially Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (commonly referred to as Drones) to detect landing targets (i.e., runways) to aid automatic landing. Most of the prior work regarding runway detection is based on simple image processing algorithms with lot of assumptions and constraints about precise position of runway in a particular image. First part of this research is to develop runway detection algorithm based on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures while the second part is runway localization using both deep learning and non-deep learning based methods. The proposed runway detection approach is two-stage modular where in the first stage the aerial image classification is achieved to find the existence of runway in that particular image. Later, in the second stage, the identified runways are localized using both conventional line detection algorithms and more recent deep learning models. The runway classification has been achieved with an accuracy of around 97\% whereas the runways have been localized with mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) score of 0.8.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

Moreover, the selected features with corresponding weights can provide information on the hidden characteristics of runways. Thus, the Adaboost-based selected feature subset can be used for both detecting runways and identifying their textural characteristics. Thus, a coarse representation of possible runway locations is obtained.

Qualitative expert review, Fr{\textbackslash}'echet Inception Distance (FID), and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) were tested for evaluation. Additionally, various segmentation models were trained with the generated data and evaluated using Dice score and Intersection over Union. We found that our pipeline produced images more akin to real polyp images based on FID scores, and segmentation performance also showed improvements over GAN methods when trained entirely, or partially, with synthetic data, despite requiring less compute for training. Moreover, the improvement persists when tested on different datasets, showcasing the transferability of the generated images.},

The result of this study demonstrated new approach for synthetic datasets creation using modern generative neural networks. To elaborate this approach, experiments were performed to generate synthetic dataset to solve the above basic computer vision problem in urban applications using the most advanced diffusion neural network models (Kandinsky 2.2). Experiments were performed on these datasets to train deep neural networks to solve the object detection problem (YOLOv5). The results of testing the trained detectors on a specially selected validation dataset showed the potential viability of a synthetic dataset generation approach using diffusion neural network models. However, full-fledged use of this approach to generate synthetic datasets that can be used in training deep neural networks of computer vision in production is accompanied by some difficulties, namely high difference between domains of real data and generated data, high labor costs of tuning trained diffusion models to achieve the highest quality of generation, etc.},

The process of procuring such real-world data is a laborious undertaking, which has prompted researchers to explore new avenues of research, such as synthetic data generation techniques. This study presents a framework for the generation of synthetic datasets by fine-tuning pretrained stable diffusion models. The synthetic datasets are then manually annotated and employed for training various object detection models. These detectors are evaluated on a real-world test set of 331 images and compared against a baseline model that was trained on real-world images. The results of this study reveal that the object detection models trained on synthetic data perform similarly to the baseline model. In the context of apple detection in orchards, the average precision deviation with the baseline ranges from 0.09 to 0.12. This study illustrates the potential of synthetic data generation techniques as a viable alternative to the collection of extensive training data for the training of deep models.},

	abstract = {We show that prompt following abilities of text-to-image models can be substantially improved by training on highly descriptive generated image captions. Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow detailed image descriptions and often ignore words or confuse the meaning of prompts. We hypothesize that this issue stems from noisy and inaccurate image captions in the training dataset. We address this by training a bespoke image captioner and use it to recaption the training dataset. We then train several text-to-image models and find that training on these synthetic captions reliably improves prompt following ability. Finally, we use these findings to build DALL-E 3: a new text-to-image generation system, and benchmark its performance on an evaluation designed to measure prompt following, coherence, and aesthetics, finding that it compares favorably to competitors. We publish samples and code for these evaluations so that future research can continue optimizing this important aspect of text-to-image systems.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing image scene classification plays an important role in a wide range of applications and hence has been receiving remarkable attention. During the past years, significant efforts have been made to develop various data sets or present a variety of approaches for scene classification from remote sensing images. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning data sets and methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all existing data sets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we propose a large-scale data set, termed “NWPU-RESISC45,” which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This data set contains 31 500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The proposed NWPU-RESISC45 1) is large-scale on the scene classes and the total image number; 2) holds big variations in translation, spatial resolution, viewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion; and 3) has high within-class diversity and between-class similarity. The creation of this data set will enable the community to develop and evaluate various data-driven algorithms. Finally, several representative methods are evaluated using the proposed data set, and the results are reported as a useful baseline for future research.},

	abstract = {In scenarios where global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) and radio navigation systems are denied, vision-based autonomous landing (VAL) for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) becomes essential. Accurate and real-time runway detection in VAL is vital for providing precise positional and orientational guidance. However, existing research faces significant challenges, including insufficient accuracy, inadequate real-time performance, poor robustness, and high susceptibility to disturbances. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel single-stage, anchor-free, and decoupled vision-based runway detection framework, referred to as YOLO-RWY. First, an enhanced data augmentation (EDA) module is incorporated to perform various augmentations, enriching image diversity, and introducing perturbations that improve generalization and safety. Second, a large separable kernel attention (LSKA) module is integrated into the backbone structure to provide a lightweight attention mechanism with a broad receptive field, enhancing feature representation. Third, the neck structure is reorganized as a bidirectional feature pyramid network (BiFPN) module with skip connections and attention allocation, enabling efficient multi-scale and across-stage feature fusion. Finally, the regression loss and task-aligned learning (TAL) assigner are optimized using efficient intersection over union (EIoU) to improve localization evaluation, resulting in faster and more accurate convergence. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that YOLO-RWY achieves AP50:95 scores of 0.760, 0.611, and 0.413 on synthetic, real nominal, and real edge test sets of the landing approach runway detection (LARD) dataset, respectively. Deployment experiments on an edge device show that YOLO-RWY achieves an inference speed of 154.4 FPS under FP32 quantization with an image size of 640. The results indicate that the proposed YOLO-RWY model possesses strong generalization and real-time capabilities, enabling accurate runway detection in complex and challenging visual environments, and providing support for the onboard VAL systems of fixed-wing UAVs.},

	abstract = {Deep learning models have been used for a variety of image processing tasks. However, most of these models are developed through supervised learning approaches, which rely heavily on the availability of large-scale annotated datasets. Developing such datasets is tedious and expensive. In the absence of an annotated dataset, synthetic data can be used for model development; however, due to the substantial differences between simulated and real data, a phenomenon referred to as domain gap, the resulting models often underperform when applied to real data. In this research, we aim to address this challenge by first computationally simulating a large-scale annotated dataset and then using a generative adversarial network (GAN) to fill the gap between simulated and real images. This approach results in a synthetic dataset that can be effectively utilized to train a deep-learning model. Using this approach, we developed a realistic annotated synthetic dataset for wheat head segmentation. This dataset was then used to develop a deep-learning model for semantic segmentation. The resulting model achieved a Dice score of 83.4{\textbackslash}\% on an internal dataset and Dice scores of 79.6\% and 83.6\% on two external Global Wheat Head Detection datasets. While we proposed this approach in the context of wheat head segmentation, it can be generalized to other crop types or, more broadly, to images with dense, repeated patterns such as those found in cellular imagery.},

	abstract = {Free-form inpainting is the task of adding new content to an image in the regions specified by an arbitrary binary mask. Most existing approaches train for a certain distribution of masks, which limits their generalization capabilities to unseen mask types. Furthermore, training with pixel-wise and perceptual losses often leads to simple textural extensions towards the missing areas instead of semantically meaningful generation. In this work, we propose RePaint: A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) based inpainting approach that is applicable to even extreme masks. We employ a pretrained unconditional DDPM as the generative prior. To condition the generation process, we only alter the reverse diffusion iterations by sampling the unmasked regions using the given image infor-mation. Since this technique does not modify or condition the original DDPM network itself, the model produces high-quality and diverse output images for any inpainting form. We validate our method for both faces and general-purpose image inpainting using standard and extreme masks. Re-Paint outperforms state-of-the-art Autoregressive, and GAN approaches for at least five out of six mask distributions. Github Repository: git.io/RePaint},
