# Implementation

_This should describe the implementation of the project. This should follow the style of the topic 6 peer review (but greatly expanded to cover the entire implementation), describing the major algorithms/techniques used, explanation of the most important parts of the code and a visual representation of the results (e.g. screenshots or graphs)._

# Evaluation

_Describe the evaluation carried out (e.g. user studies or testing on data) and give the results. This should give a critical evaluation of the project as a whole making clear successes, failures, limitations and possible extensions._

# Conclusion

_This can be a short summary of the project as a whole but it can also bring out any broader themes you would like to discuss or suggest further work._
