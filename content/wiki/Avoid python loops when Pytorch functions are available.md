Python loops execute in the speed of the Python runtime, while Pytorch functions will run in the speed of C when running in the CPU and CUDA speed when a GPU is available.

- how does C integrate with python?
- What makes Pytorch fast?
	- C/CUDA integration, offload to GPU
	- what makes GPU great for deep learning
