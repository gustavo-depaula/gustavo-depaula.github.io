In DCF analysis, the value of an asset is the sum of the cash flows of that asset. As [[One dollar today is more valuable than one dollar tomorrow]], each cashflow should be discounted by a discount rate.

Because of compound interest, the discount rates progress exponentially. This means that far away cashflows are discounted a lot more heavier than near cashflows.

$$
DCF = \dfrac{CF_1}{(1+r)^1} + \dfrac{CF_2}{(1+r)^2} + \dfrac{CF_3}{(1+r)^3} + ... + \dfrac{CF_n}{(1+r)^n}
$$
