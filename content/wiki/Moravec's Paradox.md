What we usually consider easy tasks such as mobility and perception, are really hard for computers. And what we usually consider hard tasks like algebra and games are easy for computers.

In other words, if it's easy for humans, it's hard for computers.
If it's hard for humans, it's easy for computers.

> Moravec wrote in 1988, "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".
