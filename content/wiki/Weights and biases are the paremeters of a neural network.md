$$y = x*w + b$$
In neural networks, *w*s are the called the *weights* of the neural network and the *b*s are the *biases* of the network.

Together, they are the parameters of the network.

The biases need to exist because the function $y = x*w$ is not flexible enough. If $x=0$, the result will always equal zero.
