# Introduction

The template I chose for this project is "Gather your own dataset".

This project intends to use state-of-the-art image generation models such as Latent Diffusion Models popularized by Stable Diffusion to generate a synthetic aircraft runway image dataset to be used in vision-based landing tasks. This approach can greatly increase the availability of runway images to be used in other research projects, and, by sharing the models weights freely, allow other researchers to generate their own synthetic dataset with their own desired characteristics.

# Motivation

Currently, there is an increasing interest in autonomous systems in the aerospace field. Commercial airplanes already have autopilot when the aircraft is in cruise mode, but takeoff and landing are still heavily in the pilots' hands. Machine learning models are a promising approach to help in vision-based landing, specially in the runway detection component.

Contemporary machine learning techniques usually require 10s or 100s of thousands of items in a dataset. But there is a lack of open-source datasets of aerial images that can be used in the task of runway detection. Synthetic image dataset generation can be a viable strategy to bridge this gap of data availability.

# Literature Review

In this section, prior work on building a runway dataset is reviewed. Four well-known, publicly available runway images datasets are reviewed. Additionally, papers relevant to the methodology are reviewed as well.

**LARD â€“ Landing Approach Runway Detection** \[1] is a dataset built using images from Google Earth. It uses geometry to to simulate the viewpoint of a camera in the airplane's nose seeing the runway. Along with the public dataset, code to generate images using Google Earth studio is also provided. Currently, the dataset has over 17,000 images.

**FS2020 Runway Dataset** \[2] is a public runway dataset available on Kaggle built using extracted video footage from Microsoft Flight Simulator. The researches recorded videos of airplanes landing on 60 different runways across the world in different light conditions. Then, the videos are split into several frames, and each one annotated with segmentations labels. The dataset contains 5,587 images.

**BARS: A Benchmark for Airport Runway Segmentation** \[3] is a public dataset built using images from the X-Plane, a FAA-certified flight simulator. Their dataset contains 10,256 images, collected from different airports and weather conditions, to simulate real-world scenarios.

**Runway Landing Dataset (RLD)** \[4] is also a dataset built using X-Plane. The authors built RLD to use in VALNet, a runway image segmentation network. In the paper, the researchers had access to BARS and other non-publicly available datasets. They claim to have built RLD to _"alleviate the deficiency of large-scale, high-quality, publicly available datasets for runway segmentation"_. The dataset includes images covering entire landing scenarios and different weather conditions. The dataset has 12,239 images.

LARD, the biggest dataset, is also the most recent one. The images generated by it are easily reproducible, as all the code to generate new scenarios and new images is publicly available. In the synthetic images of LARD, there are no variations in the weather conditions and night view is simulated with simple reduction of lightness in the photos, both of which create unrealistic images.

The datasets built using flight simulators (FS2020, BARS, RLD) have far better data diversity as they are able to produce realistic images in different weather and light conditions. But, as they use flight simulator games, they are not easily reproducible and extendable.

These trade-offs indicate the potential of the novel approach of this paper. A runway image generating model has the potential to be easily reproducible and extendable as well as being capable of generating images for different realistic scenarios. It could also help in generating edge-cases that are hard to replicate in flight simulators and also generate images of novel and unseen airports and runways.

The paper **Runway Detection and Localization in Aerial Images Using Deep Learning** \[5] trains a two-stage pipeline: first, there is a model that detects if there's a runway in the image and then there is another model that does localization. Their approach to runway detection is using a Resnet50 model, fine-tuned with a runway image dataset. They are able to achieve an accuracy of around 90% in detection, although the dataset used in evaluation uses images with a top-down or satellite-like camera perspective, which is not realistic in the vision-based landing scenario explored in this paper.

A hard problem in building a dataset in general is evaluating the quality of this dataset. Ideally, the best way would be to train a runway detection and segmentation model on this new dataset and evaluating the performance of this dataset. Because of time constraints, this won't be covered in this paper. But training a simple model to detect if there's a runway in the image can be a helpful proxy to the quality of the dataset.

In recent years, diffusion models have become the state-of-the-art solution in the field of generative image modelling. Diffusion models work by progressively destructing data adding noise and then training a model that learns how to progressively remove that noise, reconstructing the original data.

In the paper **_"Diffusion Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods and Applications"_** \[6], the authors provide an overview of the foundations of diffusion models and several related techniques such as _inpainting_, _DreamBooth_, and text-to-image generation. They also review several applications for diffusion models, such as _"Generating Data from Diffusion Models"_, which is the application explored in this project. The authors talk positively about diffusion models for computer vision tasks, citing that synthesizing datasets using them can effectively advance tasks such as classification and data augmentation.

## Methodology

The background research has shown the importance of datasets for researchers working on the field of detecting runways for the task of automated aircraft vision-based landing. Real-image datasets are too small to be used in deep-learning model training. Synthetic datasets bridge the gap of data availability and use simulated images from programs such as X-Plane, Microsoft Flight Simulator and Google Earth to generate the runway images.

This project's primary research question is how can a suitable synthetic image dataset be built for computational vision tasks without the need of images extracted from simulators or similar. To answer this question, the project uses the field of vision-based landing and builds a synthetic runway image dataset.

The primary users of this project are researchers that use the dataset provided in this project to build models for runway detection. Secondary users might be researchers interested in synthesizing their own datasets for computational vision tasks such as classification or segmentation.

The proposed research question begs the question of what constitutes a "suitable synthetic image dataset". Here, we rank the following characteristics that make an image dataset suitable:

1. **Human-judged realism**: humans subjectively judge the images as credible and realistic. When comparing side-by-side the images of the generated dataset with other datasets, the perceived quality of the images are the same or better.
2. **Detection by existing models**: fine-tuned models on available datasets can detect the presence and segmentation of the desired data (runways in this project) in the images.
3. **Data diversity**: the dataset has good data diversity, including edge cases and several data variations.
4. **Models' improvement**: existing models can be fine-tuned and have their performance improved by this new dataset or be trained only with the new dataset and achieve good performance.

### Hypothesis and experiments

The emergence of diffusion models for image generation creates a golden opportunity to apply this state-of-the-art technique to the problem at hand. Thus, the project will evaluate the following hypothesis: _"Can diffusion models generate a suitable runway image dataset?"_. This novel idea would be ground-breaking for the runway detection and segmentation field, because it would mean that researchers would be able to use existing techniques in the field of image generation such as _inpainting_, _DreamBooth_, and _LoRAs_ to generate their own extensive datasets with images in diverse, specific and complex scenarios.

#### Suitable image generation

To evaluate the hypothesis, a Python project using the [_Diffusers_](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index) library will be written. The first part of the project will evaluate what main techniques can be used to generate suitable images: Unconditional image generation, text-to-image generation and image-to-image generation.

##### Unconditional image generation

Unconditional image generation is a good starting point because it allows generation of images that look like those in the training dataset in a simple manner. In the context of generating runway images, we can train models using two approaches:

- Train with images of runways in their background scenery, with, for example, the airport buildings and the terrain;
- Train with cropped images that contain only or primarily the runway;

The hypothesis to be explored here is if it's possible to generate suitable images when training with the original images, because there is a possibility that the model doesn't learn the main concept of the runway and just learns to generate scenery that is found around the runway.

Training with cropped images has a better chance for the model to learn the concept and features of a runway, but it is more limited in the usefulness, as it would require other techniques, such as _Outpainting_, that extends the original image beyond its original boundaries, to generate a complete and realistic image for the dataset.

##### Text-to-image generation

Text-to-image generates an image from a text description, also known as _prompt_. Text-to-image generation is the most powerful and adaptable technique because it would allow the extension of the dataset by generating new custom images using text prompts.

The simplest way to explore the question is to start with _prompt engineering_. Prompt engineering is the technique to tweak and try different text prompts to guide the image generation process.

It is unlikely that prompt engineering alone will be able to generate suitable images for the dataset. In that case, other techniques will need to be tested:

1. **Prompt weighting**: prompt weighting is a technique that emphasize or de-emphasize certain parts of the text prompts by manipulating their embedding values. This allows for more control over the generated image as the model will focus more on certain concepts.
2. **Textual inversion**: fine-tunes the text embedding of the model to learn a new concept.
3. **DreamBooth**: fine-tunes the whole model to learn how to generate contextualized image of a given subject.

##### Image-to-image generation

Image-to-image generation is similar to text-to-image, but in addition to passing a text prompt, an image is also passed as the starting point for the diffusion process. The two techniques selected here to be explored are:

1. **ControlNet**: provides structural guidance to shape the generation of an image. It can be a pose skeleton or segmentation masks, for example, that will have their information retained and use to guide de de-noising process. ControlNet can be used to generate images in a way where the specific position of the runway is determined beforehand.
2. **Inpainting**: Inpainting modifies an existing image. It takes a mask that shows where the model should change the image. The model then tries to generate the content in the masked out area consistent with the surrounding pixels and the given prompt. It can be used to transform a scenery image into a runway image.

Another technique that could be further developed in following projects would be to use image-to-image generation to extend existing datasets. For example, the LARD datasets doesn't have different weather conditions for the images. Thus, we could use image-to-image generation to add different weather conditions (e.g., fog, rain, snow).

And because image-to-image also uses text-to-image, there's the possibility to use techniques such as Prompt weighting, textual inversion and DreamBooth alongside ControlNet and Inpainting for better performance.
