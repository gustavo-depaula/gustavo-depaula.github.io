Given a model that predicts (or estimates) a value, there are certain metrics that can be used for determining the quality of the model.

## Mean errors
These include:
- Mean Absolute Error, also called L1 Norm
	- the simplest, calculates the average of the errors
- Mean Squared Error
	- penalizes bigger errors, as the errors are squared
- Root Mean Squared Error
	- has the same feature as MSE, but by squaring, it normalizes the value to be on the same scale as the y-vector
- Relative Absolute Error
	- #unaswered 
- Relative Squared Error
	- #unaswered 
	- used to calculate $r^2$

These are calculated differently, but they are measuring the variance between actual values and predicted values, or in other words, they're trying to find how big is the [[Residuals is the difference between the predicted value and actual value|residual error]] of the model.

[[MSE vs MAE vs RMSE]]
