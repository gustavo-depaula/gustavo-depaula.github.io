As long as inflation is greater than zero or assuming that you can invest a dollar today and get a higher return than deflation, one dollar today is more valuable than one dollar tomorrow.

- If inflation is greater than zero, the value of the dollar will decrease as time passes
- If deflation, but you can invest and get a higher return than the deflation rate, you'll have more dollars as time passes
