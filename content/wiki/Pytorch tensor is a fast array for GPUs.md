Pytorch tensor is a multi-dimensional array, where all the items in it have the same type.

They're similar to NumPy arrays, but they can be stored on GPUs and use them to do operations.

- The *rank* of a tensor is how many dimensions it has.
	- you can get it by getting the len of tensor.shape
- The *shape* of a tensor is the size of each dimension
