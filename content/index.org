* About me
Hello, it's nice to have you here!

*I solve problems by writing software and talking to people!*

My primary background is building client-side applications with Javascript.
Lately I've also been doing server-side applications with Django and Python. I'm
also studying to specialize in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence.
Currently, I'm an Engineering Manager, so I'm also learning quite a lot about
that.

👨‍💻 Leading a small team [[https://www.loggi.com/][@ Loggi]] \\
👨‍🎓 Studying Computer Science [[https://london.ac.uk/courses/computer-science][@ University of London]] \\
🏡 Living in  🇧🇷Brazil 🇧🇷

** Why do you use Comic Sans?
Because it's the best font ever invented, for everything. And because I know
nothing about typography.

I also use it for coding and love it: https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font

Wholeheartedly recommend trying it. For me, it helped with me stopping
misreading words and swapping letters/words.

There's also an interesting side-effect. People tend to unfairly ridiculize
Comic Sans. So the content you write on it needs to be really good to
breakthrough this initial prejudice.

** Do you have any hobbies?
I do! Glad you asked!

** Have you watched Hamilton?
Yes. Yes. YES. Absolutely loved it.

Here's a list of some of my favorite lines:
#+begin_quote
Hamilton doesn't hesitate \\
He exhibits no restraint \\
He takes and he takes and he takes \\
And he keeps winning anyway \\
He changes the game \\
He plays and he raises the stakes \\
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Why do you write like you're running out of time? \\
Write day and night like you're running out of time? \\
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
And when my time is up \\
Have I done enough?
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name \\
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame \\
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain \\
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain \\
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
You have no control who lives, who dies, who tells your story \\
I know that we can win \\
I know that greatness lies in you \\
But remember from here on in, history has its eyes on you \\
#+end_quote
