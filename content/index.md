**Hello, it's nice to have you here!**

I am building this site to share my ideas and talk about things that I like. It is under heavy construction!

## About Me

I am a devout Roman Catholic ✝ (c. 2024) that likes to solve problems and build new things by writing software and talking to people.

The following is a port of the things in my old site. These will not be here for long, as I am planning on expanding and making new sections.

## Q&A

### Where can I follow you?

(please don't follow me in real life)

- You can send me a DM on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-depaula/)
- Follow my art page on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClassicalCharm)
- Let's play chess: [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/dpgu)
- Here's my [GitHub](https://github.com/gustavo-depaula)

### Why do you use Comic Sans?

Because it's the best font ever invented, for everything. And because I know nothing about typography.

I also use it for coding and love it: [Comic Mono Font](https://github.com/dtinth/comic-mono-font)

Wholeheartedly recommend trying it. For me, it helped with me stopping misreading words and swapping letters/words.

There's also an interesting side-effect. People tend to unfairly ridicule Comic Sans. So the content you write on it needs to be really good to break through this initial prejudice.

### Do you have any hobbies?

### Have you watched Hamilton?

Yes. Yes. YES. Absolutely loved it.

Here's a list of some of my favorite lines:

> Hamilton doesn't hesitate  
> He exhibits no restraint  
> He takes and he takes and he takes  
> And he keeps winning anyway  
> He changes the game  
> He plays and he raises the stakes

> Why do you write like you're running out of time?  
> Write day and night like you're running out of time?

> And when my time is up  
> Have I done enough?

> Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name  
> An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame  
> All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain  
> A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain

> You have no control who lives, who dies, who tells your story  
> I know that we can win  
> I know that greatness lies in you  
> But remember from here on in, history has its eyes on you

> Love doesn't discriminate  
> Between the sinners and the saints  
> It takes and it takes and it takes  
> And we keep loving anyway

> Death doesn't discriminate  
> Between the sinners and the saints  
> It takes and it takes and it takes  
> And we keep living anyway
