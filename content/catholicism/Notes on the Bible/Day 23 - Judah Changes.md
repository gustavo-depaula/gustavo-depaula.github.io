# Commentary on Genesis 43–44
**Key themes:** The brothers return to Egypt, after Judah's oath of protection of Benjamin to Israel. Joseph orders his servant to put his silver cup in Benjamin's bag along with the food. Afterwards, he sends a servant to accuse the brothers of stealing the silver cup. Judah begs Joseph to not arrest Benjamin, and to offers himself in his place.

**Literal sense:**
Joseph stages this theft to test their brother's love for Benjamin, bringing his brother Judah's change to the spotlight: He was the one that first suggested selling Joseph as a slave, and now, he begs for Joseph's mercy and protects his brother with everything he has.

**Allegorical sense:**
Benjamin is served five times more bread than the other brothers. In John, the multiplication of bread occurs over 5 pieces of bread and 2 pieces of fish.
# Commentary on Job 35–36

**Key verses:**
1.  **Gen 35:6-7** God is not affected by our wickedness nor by our righteousness.
2. **Gen 35:9-16** Elihu argues that God is not indifferent to the cries of the oppressed, it is men that are proud and forgetful of all that God has done to them. If God doesn't answer, it is due to men's lack of trust in God.

**Moral sense:**
1. Give praise to God, and not only ask for things.
# Commentary on Proverbs 4:10-19
The wicked carry the burden of their misdeeds and are restless, without peace, because of it. The righteous have peace of mind and that peace increases over time, like the light of the sun in dawn.
