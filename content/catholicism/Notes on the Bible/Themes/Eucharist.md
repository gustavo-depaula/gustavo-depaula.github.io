Can't eat the passover sacrifice if the person is unclean, just as can't commune if in state of mortal sin. Terrible consequences for both:
![[03 - Leviticus#^1a92b2]]


Some sacrifices require the eating of the sacrificed animal:
![[02 - Exodus#^e3fc7f]]
![[53 - 1 Corinthians#^abfcf2]]



The need for Baptism for the Eucharist:
![[02 - Exodus#^c7aecb]]

Just as the Old Covenant is instituted with the real blood of the animals that were sacrificed:
![[02 - Exodus#^938446]]

The new Covenant is established with the blood of Jesus, by transubstantiation, in the Last Supper:
![[53 - 1 Corinthians#^3b5ad7]]
