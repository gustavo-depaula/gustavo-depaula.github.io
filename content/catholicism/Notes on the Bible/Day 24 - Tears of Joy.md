# Commentary on Genesis 45-46
Joseph finally cries and reveals himself to his brothers. Joseph has forgiven his brothers, and sees Divine Providence (Gen 45:5) through his hardship and his brothers' mistreatment of him. He sees that all his hardship allowed him to preserve the life of his family.

When the Pharaoh heard the news about Josephâ€™s brothers, he commanded them to go to Canaan and bring their entire family, and that the Pharaoh would give them land in Egypt. Joseph sends his brothers with food for the trip and gifts for Israel.

God speaks to Israel, reiterating his promise of making a great nation out of him. He says that he will bring back the nation to Canaan. This is the final appearance of God until Moses.

Israel in Egypt is constituted of 70 people.
# Commentary on Job 37-38
Elihu continues his speech on God's power drawing analogies with the forces of nature. He says that God is the cause of all the natural laws and of mighty events such as rain and thunder. Elihu argues that God cannot be judged my men, as our finite minds cannot comprehend his greatness. He ends by saying that wisdom is fear of the Lord.

The Lord answers Job. In this first speech, he inquires Job, with the purpose of inducing humility by a series of rhetorical questions on the creation of the world and how nature works, demonstrating God's power and might and Job's littleness.
# Commentary on Proverbs 4:20-27
To keep being in the path of righteousness, you have to keep all your senses away from wickedness: your heart (what you value most), your mouth and ears (what you hear and talk), eyes (your gaze), your feet (where you heading to).
