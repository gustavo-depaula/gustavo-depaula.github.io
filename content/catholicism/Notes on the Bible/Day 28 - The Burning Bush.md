Exodus 3; Leviticus 2-3; Psalm 45;
# Commentary on Exodus 3
**Key theme:** God appears to Moses as a burning bush, that is not consumed by the fire. The Lord calls him to liberate the Hebrews from the Egyptians, through God’s actions. The Lord foretells that the Pharaoh will refuse to liberate the Hebrews, and that God’s intervention will be necessary.

**Literal sense:**
1. **Ex 3:14** God reveals himself as “I AM WHO I AM”. God’s essence is existence, the necessary being who all others are contingent on.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ex 3:2** The burning bush represents non-contingent nature: it doesn’t consume or need anything else to exist, He just exists, has always existed, and will always exist.
2. **Ex 3:2** (St Gregory of Nissa) The burning bush teaches the mystery of the Virgin Birth, doesn’t depend on natural causes (natural procreation, fuel) and doesn’t ”ruin” the means used to covey the Light of Divinity (the bush is kept intact, Mary’s virginity is kept intact).
