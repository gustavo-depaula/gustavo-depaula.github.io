Exodus 6-7; Leviticus 5; Psalm 47;
# Commentary on Exodus 6-7
**Key themes:**
1. Aaron and Moses work a miracle in front of the Pharaoh so that he let Israel set free. The Pharaoh sees the miracles, but because of his hardened heart, he doesn’t listen to them.
2. There is spiritual warfare and a battle against idolatry that is prevalent in Egypt.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The plagues bring death and destruction to Egypt, and theologically bring death and destruction to Egyptian’s idols, asserting YHWH’s supremacy over all creation as He is the one true God.
	1. The snake was an emblem of Egyptian power that represented the serpent goddess Wadjet. Aaron’s rod/serpent swallowing all the other serpents show God’s dominion.

**Moral sense:**
1. When someone has a hardened heart, miracles can’t convert them.

**Questions:**
1. Can demonic/spiritual powers manipulate nature? (Ex 7:11)
2. **Ex 7:22** How did the magicians *“did the same”* if all the water had already turned into blood?
# Commentary on Leviticus 5
When a person sins and knows about it, they need to confess their sin and bring and offering so that a priest makes atonement for their sin. (Ex 5:5, Ex 5:6)

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The New Testament continues this practice, when Jesus gives the apostles the authority to be mediators and to forgive and retain sins.
2. **Ex 5:7.11** In the same way God allows for those who don’t afford a lamb to bring two turtledoves/young pigeons, and for those who can’t even afford that to bring fine flour, God accepts our imperfect contrition in the Sacrament of Confession. By his infinite mercy, He meets us in the midst of our misery and imperfection, He just asks to offer what we have, whatever he have, even if it is almost nothing at all.
# Commentary on Psalm 47
Praises the Lord as king of over all the earth (Ps 47:2).

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ps 47:6** Prefiguration of Christ’s ascension.
2. **Ps 47:10** Prefiguration of the Church, the Kingdom of God, where jews and gentiles are gathered together
