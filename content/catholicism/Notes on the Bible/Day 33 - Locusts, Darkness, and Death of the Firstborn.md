Exodus 10-11; Leviticus 8; Psalm 50;
# Commentary on Exodus 10-11
**Key themes:**
1. Eight and ninth plagues (Locusts, Darkness) and warning of the final plague (death of the firstborn).

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ex 10:26** God defines how He wants to be worshipped. Divine Liturgy comes from Divine Revelation and not human will. Worship is done through sacrifice. In the New Covenant, worship is done through the Eucharist sacrifice, as commanded by Christ Himself *“Do this in remembrance of me”*.
# Commentary on Leviticus 8
**Key themes:**
2. Ordination offerings of Aaron and his sons. Profound and extended/long ritual.
# Commentary on Psalm 50
The outward signs of religion (sacrifices in this case) must be accompanied by an interior act of thanksgiving and prayer, and of following the commandments.
