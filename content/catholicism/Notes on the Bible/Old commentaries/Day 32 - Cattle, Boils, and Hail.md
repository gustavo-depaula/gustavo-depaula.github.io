Exodus 9; Leviticus 7; Psalm 49;
# Commentary on Exodus 9
**Key themes:**
1. Fifth, sixth, seventh plagues (death to the livestock, outbreak of boils, hailstone storms). Pharaoh gives a insincere repentance, but as soon as the plagues stopped, he sinned again and continued to harden his heart.
2. God could’ve already killed Pharaoh, but He lets he lives for divine purpose (His name being declared throughout all the earth, to show that Israel is His chosen people ?) **(Ex 9:16)**

# Commentary on Leviticus 7
**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Lv 7:19-21** Prefigures the eating of the flesh of the ultimate sacrifice, the Eucharist, and how it is a sacrilege to commune while carrying mortal sins.
2. Moreover, holy things are separated, dedicated for special uses and should be approached with purity.
# Commentary on Psalm 49
**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ps 49:15** God will liberate the soul of the just from “Sheol”, where the dead went before Christ opened the doors of heaven.
2. **Ps 49:19** The wicked will never more see the light.
3. Clear prefigurations of heaven and hell, judgement of the souls after death: liberation for the just, privation of the light for the wicked.
