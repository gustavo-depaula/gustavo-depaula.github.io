# Commentary on Job 41–42
The Book of Job addresses the problem of evil, but doesn’t *answers* it. It is quite a journey, indeed. The answer of the problem of evil is God itself, apparently.

God is operating on a vastly more complex set of decisions He has to make that we can’t comprehend or grasp. Job is humbled by this reality, and is in peace with his suffering, because he knows he can’t understand.

God reprehends Job’s friends for not speaking the truth, and commands them to do a burnt offering sacrifice and ask for the prayer (intercession) of Job.

The Lord then gives Job twice as much as he had before.
# Commentary on Psalm 17 

**Anagogical sense:**
1. **Psalm 17:15** Only the beatific vision can fully satisfy our desire for happiness, can fulfill our ultimate goal, what we were made for. Saint Augustine: *“Fecisti nos, Domine, ad Te, et inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in Te.”
