# Commentary on Genesis 31–32
Jacob feels distrust and hostility from Laban and his sons, and the Lord said to Jacob to return to Canaan. He tells his wives (Leah and Rachel) that their father has cheated him, but the Lord helped him by giving him instructions on how to breed the selected animals so that Jacob could have a large flock. Jacob flees Laban house without telling him, and Rachel steals household Gods, showing an attachment to paganism.

Laban and his kinsmen go out to find Jacob, but the Lord came to Laban through a dream saying to not confront (*“say not a word”* Gen 31:24) Jacob. Laban finds Jacob and confronts on why he left without telling nobody, because Laban would make a feast for him. He also confronts why Jacob stole his gods, and they don’t know that it was Rachel. So he allows Laban to search the tents, but Rachel has hidden them and lies so that her father doesn’t find the household gods.

Jacob and Laban end up making a covenant.

Returning to Canaan, Jacob sees a vision of angels, just as he saw a vision when leaving Canaan 20 years before.

Jacob sends a message to Esau saying that Esau is Jacob’s lord, to appease Esau’s anger. The messenger returns saying that Esau is coming with 400 men. Jacob prays, and then prepared for an invasion, divided his camps, and sent an unusually large present to Esau.

In a night, Job “wrestled” with a nameless angel for the whole night. He ends up “winning”, and gets a blessing that changes his name to Israel, but injures his thigh.

**Allegorical sense**:
1. TODO: St Augustin: the angel is a type of Christ, and the defeat points to the Passion of Christ, where simultaneously some are blessed and some are crippled by unbelief.

**Moral sense**:
1. TODO: St Ambrose: wrestle with God is struggle for virtue.
# Commentary on Job 21–22
Job responds by saying that the wicked, in contrast to what their friends say, often prosper. There are a lot of wicked people, godless people that reach old ages, have power, have wealth, and have kids. Job disputes the idea of strict correlation between morality and temporal fortunes.

Eliphaz continues with the accusations, and accuses Job of several sins against charity, like withholding bread from the hungry. Eliphaz argues that the wicked’s prosperity is fleeting, and that judgement comes. He urges Job to repent, and his advice on repenting (Job 22:21-27) is actually good, although it does not apply in this circumstance: seeking peace with God, take his words to the heart, remove unrighteousness, value God more the gold, spend time in prayer.
# Commentary on Proverbs 3:9-12
Verses 9-10 is a call to contribute to the Church, through tithes. That is honoring the Lord, and brings temporal blessings.

Verses 11-12 is a call to not fear Divine discipline, which usually come in the form of disappoints and suffering, *as God reproves whom he loves*.
