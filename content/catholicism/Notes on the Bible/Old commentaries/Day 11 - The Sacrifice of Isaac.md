# Commentary on Genesis 22-23

God tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice his only-begotten son Isaac. Abraham binds Isaac in the altar, and when he was about to immolate the sacrificial offering (Isaac), an angel of the Lord stops him and provides a ram (lamb) to be burnt instead. God makes an oath to bless Abraham and bless all nations through Abraham offspring. 

Nahor, Abraham's brother, had children with his wife (Milcah) and his concubine (Reumah). Nahor is the father of Bethuel, the father of Rebekah (future wife of Isaac).

Sarah dies, and Abraham buys a plot of land to bury her from the Hittites, the descendants of Heth, one of the ten tribes that occupied Canaan.

**Notes:**
1. It is unlikely that Abraham bound Isaac by force. Abraham is an old man at this point and Isaac is an adult (this is demonstrated by his capacity to carry the wood for the burn offering, something a child couldn't do).
2. Abraham trusted that God would do something about Isaac, as God made a covenant with him that He would multiply his descendants through Isaac.
3. God is testing here Abraham's obedience, faithfulness and priorities: where does Abraham puts his heart? the Creator or the creatures the Creator gave him?

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The sacrifice of Isaac is a prefiguration of the sacrifice of Jesus:
	1. Isaac is the only-begotten son of Abraham. Jesus is the only-begotten son of God.
	2. Isaac carries the wood to be used in the sacrifice on his back just as Jesus carries the cross.
2. God stops the sacrifice of Isaac and provides a lamb instead, which also points to Christ, as Christ is the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

**Moral sense:**
1. Despite his previous faults, Abraham is the father of the faith because of his excellent obedience and fear of God.

# Commentary on Job 11-12

Another friend of Job speaks this time, Zophar. Zophar delivers a harsh speech, accusing Job of "babbling" and "mockery". Zophar emphasizes God's limitless might and wisdom, and that not even the scale of creation can be compared to the scale of God's "limits". Zophar doesn't believe Job is blameless and says that God asks of him less than he truly deserves. If Job repents ("set your heart alright"), there will be hope and this all will pass.

Job answers with frustration and sarcasm (Job 12:2). He feels unheard, as his friends treat his claims of innocence as ignorance of wisdom, but he is trained in wisdom just as they are and understand that God is almighty over all creation.
# Commentary on Proverbs 2:9-15

Seeking knowledge is good, as the wisdom acquired gives you discretion and understanding to walk in the right path.
