## Genesis 1 & 2; Psalm 19;

The creation story of genesis is unique among creation stories because all other stories involve a god or gods creating the world out of violence, destruction, sex or desire for having slaves to do the work or entertain them.

Differently, the Hebrew word used in Genesis to talk about the creation is _“Bara”_, which means create out of nothing.

**Why did God create us?**  
To share in his perfect and good divine nature, **“to share in his blessed life”** as the Catechism puts it. We do that by **labor** (working as God has worked to create us), **leisure** (as God rested after work), and **love** (as God loves us and is infinite love).

Genesis also establishes where we get our dignity from. It is not from our strength, power, beauty, wisdom or a government. We get our dignity from the fact that every human being - male and female - is made in God’s image and likeness.

A little poem about the creation of Eve and male/female equality in dignity:

> “When God took Eve from Adam,  
> He did not take her from his head to Lord over him,  
> Nor from his foot to be walked upon by him.  
> He took her from his side, to walk with him;  
> From beneath his arms to be guarded by him;  
> And from near his heart to be loved by him.”  

—A little bit cheesy, but I like it!
