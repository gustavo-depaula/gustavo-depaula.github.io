I'm reading the Bible with the help of the amazing ["Bible In A Year"](https://media.ascensionpress.com/category/ascension-podcasts/bibleinayear/) podcast by the incredible Fr. Mike Schmitz. He reads the Sacred Scriptures not in the order of the books, but divided in a way where passages of multiple books are read each day in a way that the readings are in-context, making the narrative easier to follow.

There's also the book ["Walking with God: A Journey Through the Bible"](https://ascensionpress.com/) by Tim Gray and Jeff Cavins, which follows the same timeline. The podcast uses the Revised Standard Version - Catholic Edition. I read it through the Ascension Press app.

Although the idea is to listen/read day-by-day so you can finish in a year, I fail miserably at that goal ðŸ˜…. Both because of lack of discipline and want/need to read multiple times the same passages so I can understand better what's bein said, because there is so much to learn and so many layers of meaning.

These are my notes, thoughts, interpretations and questions about the Bible. I'm a layman and recent convert, not a theologian, so take this as an amateur's _exegesis_.

If you hover over the Bible references, you'll see the text of the verse. If you click on it, you'll be taken to the Bible passage in [Bible Gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/).

Iâ€™m using the Ignatius Study Bible, that uses the RSV-2CE translation, with excellent footnotes and essays that explain how the Bible and Catholic Tradition and Magisterium make sense together.

Recently, Iâ€™m exploring the Quadriga hermeneutics, a four-fold method of biblical interpretation used in the Patristic and Medieval era. In the Quadriga, scripture has four senses:
- Literal sense: literal/historical interpretation of the events in the text
- Allegorical/typological sense: What allegories can be drawn from the text, specially what connections between the Old and New Testaments and the life of Christ?
- Moral/Tropological sense: how one should act based on the senses
- Anagogical sense: deals with prophecies and future events, heaven, hell and the Last Judgement

*Lettera gesta docet,*  
*quid credas allegoria,*  
*Moralia quid agas,*  
*quo tendas, anagogia*

The literal teaches history,  
the allegorical, what you should believe,  
the moral, what you should do,  
the anagogical, where you are going.
