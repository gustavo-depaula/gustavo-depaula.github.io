# Genesis 16-17; Job 5-6; Proverbs 1:20-33;

Commentary of Genesis 16:
1. Sarai, troubled by her infertility, decides to have children through her maid.
2. Abram listens and has relations with Hagar, Sar’ai’s Egyptian maid.
3. Hagar conceives and treats Sarai with contempt.
4. Sarai retaliates, dealing harshly with Hagar for her behavior and she flees.
5. Hagar tries to go back to Egypt, but in the route, an angel appears to her and says to her to go back and submit to her mistress. The angel also promises to greatly multiply her descendants and says that he will be a “wild donkey”.
6. Hagar gives birth to a son and Abram names him “Ish’mael”

Sarai’s actions are in accordance with ancient Near East practice of surrogate motherhood through servants or concubines. Childless couples resorted to this to produce an heir. There are historical evidence of this practice in the Nuzi tables and the Babylonian *Code of Hammurabi*.

“Abram listened”: might be a reference to Adam listening to Eve in the garden (Gen 3:17) and maybe explains the name Ish’mael. The Hebrew word for “listened” (*yishma’*) is the verbal root for the name Ish’mael (*yishma’e’l*).

I know sexual ethics in that times are radically different from what we are used to in our Christian societies, and polygamy was way more prevalent in those times. Still, this idea by Sar’ai comes from a place of complete desperation. One can empathize with the frustration of wanting, and having been promised (by God!), to have a child and still not being able to conceive.

Still, this sin, of not trusting God’s plan, of wanting to have God’s way in our own terms, leads to more destruction. As the sin breads tension and retaliation. And ultimately, brings forth a “wild donkey” (aggressive) man into the world.

The oppression of Hagar will also backfire when the Joseph, Sarai’s great grandson (Joseph) is taken as a slave in Egypt by the “Ishmael-ites” (Gen 39:1) and the family of Israel that follows him there is “oppressed” by the Egyptians (Ex 1:12, foretold in Gen 15:13).
