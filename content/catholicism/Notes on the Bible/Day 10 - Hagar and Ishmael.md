Genesis 20-21; Job 9-10; Proverbs 6-8;

## Commentary on Genesis 20:
1. Abraham goes to Gerar, a territory in southern Palestine, near Gaza.
2. There, he tells the same lie to the King of Gerar, Abimelech, that he told to the Pharaoh: that Sara is his sister, and not his wife. Later, we discover that this is a “half-truth”. Abraham is Sara’s half-sister, they have the same father but different mothers.
3. The King takes Sara as his wife, but God appears to him in a dream, saying that He kept him from sinning, and that if he doesn’t return Sara, he’ll be punished.
4. Abimelech then restores Sara to Abraham and gives him animals and slaves.
5. God restores fertility in the house of the king after having had “closed all the wombs”.
