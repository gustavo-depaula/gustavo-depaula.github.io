Genesis 20-21; Job 9-10; Proverbs 2:6-8;

**Commentary on Genesis 20:**
1. Abraham goes to Gerar, a territory in southern Palestine, near Gaza.
2. There, he tells the same lie to the King of Gerar, Abimelech, that he told to the Pharaoh: that Sarah is his sister, and not his wife. Later, we discover that this is a “half-truth”. Abraham is Sarah’s half-sister, they have the same father but different mothers.
3. The King takes Sarah as his wife, but God appears to him in a dream, saying that He kept him from sinning, and that if he doesn’t return Sarah, he’ll be punished.
4. Abimelech then restores Sarah to Abraham and gives him animals and slaves.
5. God restores fertility in the house of the king after having had “closed all the wombs”.

**Commentary on Genesis 21:**
1. Sarah conceives and gives birth to Isaac, as the Lord had promised, and he was circumcised when his was eight days old. Isaac means “he laughs”.
2. Sarah tells Abraham to expel Hagar and Ishmael. God says to do what Sarah says, and not to worry, as God will make a great nation out of Ishmael.
3. Abraham and Abimelech make a covenant (a friendship covenant?).

One minor note is that it seems that Genesis is very concerned with explaining the names and the origin of people, places and nations.

**Commentary on Job 9-10:**
1. Job recognizes the omnipotence, wisdom and might of God.
2. And because of that, he feels impotent, because although he knows he is innocent, how can one says that God is wrong?
3. Therefore, he can only appeal to his mercy.
4. Job feels that God is responsible for his suffering, but complaining is useless because there is no one above God to “judge” the cause.
5.
