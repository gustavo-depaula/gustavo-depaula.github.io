# Commentary on Genesis 38
What a mess…

Judah marries a Canaanite woman (unnamed), daughter of Shua. They had three sons: Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er married Tamar. But Er was wicked and the Lord slew him. Then, Judah ordered Onan to go into Tamar, so that Er and Tamar shall have offspring.

But Onan went into Tamar, but spilled his seed on the ground, and that was wicked in the sight of the Lord and He slew him also.

Judah sends Tamar to her father’s house to be a widow, and promised to give Shelah in marriage when he grows up. But, later, after the death of Judah’s wife, Shelah has grown up, but he is not given in marriage to Tamar.

So Tamar covers herself as a “harlot” (a prostitute) and stands by at the road side waiting for Judah to pass by. Judah goes into Tamar, without knowing it was his daughter-in-law.

Judah recognizes that what she has done was wicked, but says that she is more righteous than him, as he didn’t gave Shelah to her. Tamar gives birth to twins: Perez and Zerah. Zerah put out his hand first, but Perez left out the womb completely first.

**Notes:**
Perez is the genealogical ancestor to David, and ultimately to Jesus the Messiah. God can indeed make a good thing out of a mess.

**Moral sense:**
Onan’s sin is twofold:
1. The intention (why)
2. The act (how)
The levirate custom (the brother-in-law marriage) was not a capital offense in the law of Moses (to be declared later). Onan could refuse the levirate marriage, but it was considered shameful.

Since God slew Onan for his offense, it makes much more sense that Onan’s sin was also a sexual transgression, on par with sexual sins that have the death penalty in biblical law.

Onanism is the sin of separating the unitive and procreative ends of the marital act, covering contraception and masturbation.
# Commentary on Job 29–30
In chapter 29, Job reflects on his past days, when things were better, “when God was with him”. And how he was righteous and wise, and generous with those who needed help. But now, there is only suffering, and all the poor and necessitated now disdain him because of his situation.
# Commentary on Proverbs 3:28-32
Treat well your neighbors, don’t cause trouble for no reason. Don’t envy perverse men.
