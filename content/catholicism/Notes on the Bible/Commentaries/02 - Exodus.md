# Chapters 1-2
**Key themes:**
1. The Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly. The new Pharaoh sees them as threat, so he enslaves them, making them work in rigorous jobs. The Pharaoh then enacts a plan to weaken the Hebrews: kill the male newborns by casting them into the Nile.
2. Moses is born and is adopted by the Pharaoh’s daughter. After killing an Egyptian that was beating up a Hebrew, he flees Egypt, as the Pharaoh wanted to kill him. He ends up in Midian, where he marries a daughter of a priest and has a son named Gershom.
3. The King of Egypt ,the Pharaoh, dies.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ex 2:11-12** Moses frees a Hebrew getting beaten up by an Egyptian, just as he frees the Hebrew people from Egyptian slavery. Just as Christ frees us from sin.
2. **Ex 2:14** Moses indeed becomes a prince and a judge over the Israelites. Type of Christ: Christ is the prince and judge over everyone.

**Moral sense:**
1. **Ex 1:21** Family and children are seen as rewards and blessings
2. **Ex 1:18-21** God/Natural Law is above the Civil Law. It is ok to disobey (maybe lie?) the civil law if it is against God/Natural law.

# Chapter 3
**Key theme:**
1. God appears to Moses as a burning bush, that is not consumed by the fire. The Lord calls him to liberate the Hebrews from the Egyptians, through God’s actions. The Lord foretells that the Pharaoh will refuse to liberate the Hebrews, and that God’s intervention will be necessary.

**Literal sense:**
1. **Ex 3:14** God reveals himself as “I AM WHO I AM”. God’s essence is existence, the necessary being who all others are contingent on.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ex 3:2** The burning bush represents non-contingent nature: it doesn’t consume or need anything else to exist, He just exists, has always existed, and will always exist.
2. **Ex 3:2** (St Gregory of Nissa) The burning bush teaches the mystery of the Virgin Birth, doesn’t depend on natural causes (natural procreation, fuel) and doesn’t ”ruin” the means used to covey the Light of Divinity (the bush is kept intact, Mary’s virginity is kept intact).

# Chapters 4-5
**Key themes:**
1. To prove the Divine Revelation to Moses, the Lord gives signs for Moses to perform in front of the people, so that they believe him. Moses’ brother is the one who performs the sign, because Moses was afraid. Moses returns to Egypt, Aaron performs the signs and the people believed.
2. Aaron and Moses beg Pharaoh to let the Hebrews go into the wilderness for three days to make a feast to make sacrifices to God. Pharaoh not only rejects, but deals more harshly with the them, making them work without the necessary materials, but with the same production quota.

**Questions:**
1. What is happening in Ex 4:24-26??

**Literal sense:**
1. The signs were: the rod that becomes a serpent and back (Ex 4:3), the hand that became leprous and healed (Ex 4:6), water of the Nile that turned into blood (Ex 4:9).
2. Offerings/sacrifice were deemed abominable to the Egyptians, that were idolatrous and revered animals as living images of the gods.
3. **Ex 4:21** God foretells the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart. The hardening of the heart of Pharaoh by God is a response to Pharaoh’s hardening his own heart first. God’s reaction is a removal of the gift of mercy after rejection by Pharaoh.

**Moral sense:**
1. **Ex 4:10** “I am not sufficient”, says Moses. Paul alludes to that passage (2 Cor 3:5) when he says the same about him, but he learns to accept his mission and allow the grace of God to compensate for his weaknesses. Learn to accept that God is and will be with you through all hardships and He will give you the necessary strength to survive the storm.

# Chapters 6-7
**Key themes:**
1. Aaron and Moses work a miracle in front of the Pharaoh so that he let Israel set free. The Pharaoh sees the miracles, but because of his hardened heart, he doesn’t listen to them.
2. There is spiritual warfare and a battle against idolatry that is prevalent in Egypt.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The plagues bring death and destruction to Egypt, and theologically bring death and destruction to Egyptian’s idols, asserting YHWH’s supremacy over all creation as He is the one true God.
   1. The snake was an emblem of Egyptian power that represented the serpent goddess Wadjet. Aaron’s rod/serpent swallowing all the other serpents show God’s dominion.

**Moral sense:**
1. When someone has a hardened heart, miracles can’t convert them.

**Questions:**
1. Can demonic/spiritual powers manipulate nature? (Ex 7:11)
2. **Ex 7:22** How did the magicians _“did the same”_ if all the water had already turned into blood?

# Chapter 8
**Key themes:**
1. Egypt is afflicted by the second, third, and fourth plagues (frogs, gnats, and flies). The Pharaoh agrees to let Israel go if the plagues stopped, but Pharaoh hardened his heart each time, not complying with his promise each time.

# Chapter 9
**Key themes:**
1. Fifth, sixth, seventh plagues (death to the livestock, outbreak of boils, hailstone storms). Pharaoh gives a insincere repentance, but as soon as the plagues stopped, he sinned again and continued to harden his heart.
2. God could’ve already killed Pharaoh, but He lets he lives for divine purpose (His name being declared throughout all the earth, to show that Israel is His chosen people ?) **(Ex 9:16)**

# Chapters 10-11
**Key themes:**
1. Eight and ninth plagues (Locusts, Darkness) and warning of the final plague (death of the firstborn).

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Ex 10:26** God defines how He wants to be worshipped. Divine Liturgy comes from Divine Revelation and not human will. Worship is done through sacrifice. In the New Covenant, worship is done through the Eucharist sacrifice, as commanded by Christ Himself _“Do this in remembrance of me”_.
Exodus ; Leviticus ; Psalm ;
# Chapter 12
**Key themes:**
1. God institutes the Passover, whereby a lamb is sacrificed to God, eaten, and its blood passed on the doors of the house so that they are protected from the last plague (the death of the firstborn). The ritual is a memorial that is to be repeated every year.

**Literal sense:**
1. God was justified in killing the first-born. We know this because:
2. God is always just. Remember the promise to Abraham in Sodoma and Gomorrah, where the Lord would not destroy the city if there were just people there.
3. God is the giver of life, so He is the one who decides who lives and who dies, this is a gift given to us that He can remove at His will.
4. Retribution for the Egyptian killing of all male babies of Israel.

**Allegorical sense:**
5. The institution of the Passover prefigures the institution of the Eucharist. The lamb prefigures Christ, the lamb of God. The Passover saves Jews from the death of the last plague, while the Eucharist saves us from the death of sin and eternal punishment. The Passover redeems the Jews from slavery in Egypt, while Christ’s sacrifice redeems us from the the slavery of sin.
6. **Ex 12:5** The Lamb of the sacrifice should be without “blemish”, just as Christ is a pure lamb of God to be sacrificed.
7. **Ex 12:48** Prefigures the need for baptism as a requirement for the Eucharist. Also shows that “memorial” is not just a meal in honor or remembrance of, it is higher spiritual reality where the Passover event becomes present.

**Moral sense:**
8. **Ex 12:36** *As the Israelites plundered the spoils of Egypt and put them to better use, so believers should not fear to take what is useful and true from pagan learning for the benefit of Christian teaching (St. Augustine, On Christian Doctrine 2, 40, 60).*
# Chapter 13-14
**Key themes:**
1. The Egyptians, with their hardened hard, persecute the Israelites with their army. The Lord then works a miracle through Moses where he opens the Red Sea, allowing Israel to escape, and drowning the Egyptians behind them.
2. The Israelites don’t trust in God’s providence, and think it would be better to be slaves in Egypt. (Ex 14:10-12)

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The crossing of the Red Sea is a type of Baptism. St Paul says this in 1 Cor 10:1-2. They bring salvation through water and the power of God, and causes the demise of the enemy (Pharaoh, devil’s tyranny / original sin). The sons of Israel emerges from the sea with a new faith (Ex 14:31), just like Baptism infuses the virtue of faith.
# Chapter 15-16
**Key themes:**
1. The Israelites like to complain, distrust and disobey the commands given by God. God feeds Israel through Manna, a angelic “bread from heaven” that only last for one day.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. Manna is a prefiguration of the Eucharist. Jesus talks about himself as the bread from heaven Jn 6:30-59, St Paul in 1 Cor 10:1-6 makes the allegorical connection between the crossing of the Red Sea and Manna to Baptism and the Eucharist.

**Moral sense:**
1. Manna spoiling after a day teaches the people to rely on and trust the Providence.
2. How many people prefer the slavery to sin than the uncomfortable process of breaking their chains to make them free?

**Questions:**
3. **Ex 16:34** Aaron placed it before the stone tables of the law, but they have not received it yet…
