###  **Mark 7:24-30** *The Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith*
> **27** And he said to her, “Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”  
> **28** But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”  
> **29** And he said to her, “For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.”  
> **30** And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.

Key terms:
- **"children"** is Israel/the Jews, the chosen people, whom Jesus has come to primarily
- **"bread"** is the blessings brought by the Messiah
- **"dogs"** are how jews referred to gentiles (but Jesus uses the diminutive form, like "little dogs", "house pets")

Jesus tests the woman's faith, not insulting her, but establishing that His mission is first to the Jews, the chosen people (v. 27) (cf. Romans 1:16). The woman acknowledges it, but appeals to His mercy (v. 28). Jesus praises her faith in perseverance in v. 29.
