# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. Elkanah, an Epharimite, has two wives: Hannah and Penninah. Penninah has children, but Hannah doesn’t.
2. Through persistent prayer and faith in the Lord, Hannah is able to conceive. The child is named Samuel.

Although Elkanah was Ephraimite by residence, he was a Levite by blood.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Hannah’s prayer. Starts similar to the Magnificat. Also remembers the Sermon on the mountain. It brings themes of contrast and how the Lord helps those in need and punishes the wicked.
2. Eli, the priest, had two very corrupt sons. Prophecy of God of downfall of his house because of it.
3. Samuel started to minister under Eli.
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. The Lord reveals to Samuel that He will punish Eli’s house for their sons’ blasphemy and the refusal of Eli of restraining them. Eli accepts God’s will.

**Moral sense:**
1. We need to put ourselves close to the Lord to be able to hear His voice, just Samuel heard the Lord when he was sleeping within the temple.
# Chapter 4
**Key themes:**
1. Israel fights with the Philistines. After losing a battle, they bring out the Ark of the Covenant with them. But still, they lost, and the Ark was captured.
2. The sons of Eli are slain in the battle. Eli died when he heard of the news.

**Moral sense:**
1. Do not use God just as a tool to get whatever temporal goods you want. Truly holy objects and God Himself can become idols in our hearts.
2. The Philistines showed more reverence and feared the Lord more than the Israelites.
# Chapter 5
**Key themes:**
1. The Philistines put the Ark in the House of Dagon - Dagon being an idol and the House some sort of temple. Every morning, while the Ark stayed there, Dagon appeared on the ground, broken.
2. The people of the city were inflicted with tumors wherever the Ark was, so the Philistines decided (or just thought about it?) to return the Ark.
# Chapter 6
**Key themes:**
1. The Philistines sent back the Ark of the Covenant along with a burnt offering of golden figures.
2. It arrived in Beth-shemesh, and people offered the cows which the Ark was on as burnt offering.
3. Some men are killed for looking into the Ark, in breach of the law (Num 4:20).

**Questions:**
1. What are these five golden tumors and five golden mice? Idols?
2. What did the people at Beth-shemesh did with the golden figures?
# Chapter 7
**Key themes:**
1. After the slaughter of Beth-shemesh, the Ark is sent to Kiriath-jearim, to stay in the house of Abinadab, with Eleazar being responsible for it. It stayed there 20 years. Story of the Ark continues at 2 Samuel 6.
2. Samuel convinces Israel to leave the idols (Baals and Ashtaroth) to serve the Lord alone.
3. The people is united in Mizpah to ask forgiveness for sins, and for Samuel to pray over them.
4. The Philistines attack Israel at Mizpah, but through the Lord's intercession, Israel wins, and liberates its cities from the dominance of the Philistines.
5. There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

**Questions:**
1. What does it mean to say that "Samuel judged Israel" (1 Samuel 7:15-17)
# Chapter 8
**Key themes:**
1. Samuel appoints his sons as judges, but they are wicked and do not follow the path of Samuel.
2. Because Samuel is now old, and his sons are wicked, the Elders ask for a king to be appointed.
3. The Lord commands Samuel to do as the Elders ask, for they *"have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them."* (1 Samuel 8:7)
4. Samuel warns the people giving the "cons" of having a king, an anti-monarchical speech. But the people still wanted a king, so God commands Samuel to appoint a king.
