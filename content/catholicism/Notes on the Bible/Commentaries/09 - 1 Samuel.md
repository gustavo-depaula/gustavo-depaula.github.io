# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. Elkanah, an Epharimite, has two wives: Hannah and Penninah. Penninah has children, but Hannah doesn’t.
2. Through persistent prayer and faith in the Lord, Hannah is able to conceive. The child is named Samuel.

Although Elkanah was Ephraimite by residence, he was a Levite by blood.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Hannah’s prayer. Starts similar to the Magnificat. Also remembers the Sermon on the mountain. It brings themes of contrast and how the Lord helps those in need and punishes the wicked.
2. Eli, the priest, had two very corrupt sons. Prophecy of God of downfall of his house because of it.
3. Samuel started to minister under Eli.
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. The Lord reveals to Samuel that He will punish Eli’s house for their sons’ blasphemy and the refusal of Eli of restraining them. Eli accepts God’s will.

**Moral sense:**
1. We need to put ourselves close to the Lord to be able to hear His voice, just Samuel heard the Lord when he was sleeping within the temple.
