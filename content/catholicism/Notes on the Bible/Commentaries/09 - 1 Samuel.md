# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. Elkanah, an Epharimite, has two wives: Hannah and Penninah. Penninah has children, but Hannah doesn’t.
2. Through persistent prayer and faith in the Lord, Hannah is able to conceive. The child is named Samuel.

Although Elkanah was Ephraimite by residence, he was a Levite by blood.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Hannah’s prayer. Starts similar to the Magnificat. Also remembers the Sermon on the mountain. It brings themes of contrast and how the Lord helps those in need and punishes the wicked.
2. Eli, the priest, had two very corrupt sons. Prophecy of God of downfall of his house because of it.
3. Samuel started to minister under Eli.
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. The Lord reveals to Samuel that He will punish Eli’s house for their sons’ blasphemy and the refusal of Eli of restraining them. Eli accepts God’s will.

**Moral sense:**
1. We need to put ourselves close to the Lord to be able to hear His voice, just Samuel heard the Lord when he was sleeping within the temple.
# Chapter 4
**Key themes:**
1. Israel fights with the Philistines. After losing a battle, they bring out the Ark of the Covenant with them. But still, they lost, and the Ark was captured.
2. The sons of Eli are slain in the battle. Eli died when he heard of the news.

**Moral sense:**
1. Do not use God just as a tool to get whatever temporal goods you want. Truly holy objects and God Himself can become idols in our hearts.
2. The Philistines showed more reverence and feared the Lord more than the Israelites.
# Chapter 5
**Key themes:**
1. The Philistines put the Ark in the House of Dagon - Dagon being an idol and the House some sort of temple. Every morning, while the Ark stayed there, Dagon appeared on the ground, broken.
2. The people of the city were inflicted with tumors wherever the Ark was, so the Philistines decided (or just thought about it?) to return the Ark.
