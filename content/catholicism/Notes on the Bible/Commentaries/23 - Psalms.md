# Psalm 53
**Ps 53:1** *The fool says in his heart, “There is no God”.*

# Psalm 71
Psalm to praise God and deliver your hopes unto God because He is great, and He will not forsake us and will bring us back up. Sufferings and injustice shall not make us stop praising the Lord, because He is great. He is indeed all-powerful and all-just. Who is like Him?
# Psalm 73

# Psalm 74

A Psalm admiring God's power and majesty, and how He alone is able to utter judgement and save the oppressed.
# Psalm 77
The psalmist expresses a longing for God. He currently is going through an affliction and wants again the presence of the Lord in his life. He praises the Lord and his deeds, but he is not seeing them in his life right now. He recognizes that the Lord is the greatest and the most powerful.

*Allegorically*, it represents the longing we all have in our hearts for the ultimate happiness, beauty, good, and truth that is God, that moves all people towards religion.

*Morally*, we can be honest to God that we miss Him, and in this time of trouble we can’t feel His presence, but we must always meditate upon His greatness and remember all that He has done for us.
# Psalm 78
Wow! Great Psalm.

Celebrates God’s might and deeds, and shows how Israel was unfaithful to Him, spite all His glory and all that He has done for them (us). But in His infinite mercy, He accepts our imperfect repentance of our terrible misery.

**Psalm 78:34–38:**
*34 When he slew them, they sought for him;*
    *they repented and sought God earnestly.*
*35 They remembered that God was their rock,*
    *the Most High God their redeemer.*
*36 But they flattered him with their mouths;*
    *they lied to him with their tongues.*
*37 Their heart was not steadfast toward him;*
    *they were not true to his covenant.*
*38 Yet he, being compassionate,*
    *forgave their iniquity,*
    *and did not destroy them;*
    *he restrained his anger often,*
    *and did not stir up all his wrath.*

**Allegorical sense:**
1. Attrition / imperfect contrition.

# Psalm 114

# Psalm 115
Contrasts God's power, that is in heaven and does whatever He wants (Ps 115:3), with the idols that have eyes but do not see, ears but do not hear, etc..., that are impotent, that have no power. And all of the ones that make and trust idols are impotent as them.
# Psalm 119
**Key themes:**
1. Damn, this guy *really* loves the Law!!
