Because of Psalm 52, we know that Doeg, the Edomite, was the one who told Saul that David passed through the Ahimelech’s house.

In a general sense, it criticizes those wicked men that do evil and destruction, and how, when they are avenged, the righteous will recognize the effects making personal wealth their refuge instead of God.

In a specific sense, it seems to be talking about Saul and his evil doings.

*Allegorically*, it represents the longing we all have in our hearts for the ultimate happiness, beauty, good, and truth that is God, that moves all people towards religion.

*Morally*, we can be honest to God that we miss Him, and in this time of trouble we can’t feel His presence, but we must always meditate upon His greatness and remember all that He has done for us.
# Psalm 78
Wow! Great Psalm.

Celebrates God’s might and deeds, and shows how Israel was unfaithful to Him, spite all His glory and all that He has done for them (us). But in His infinite mercy, He accepts our imperfect repentance of our terrible misery.

    *they repented and sought God earnestly.*

    *they were not true to his covenant.*

The Lord reigns and will judge the earth and its people with *His truth*.

# Psalm 100
A thanksgiving Psalm, not for any good He has done particularly, but because He has created us and is good, loving and faithful.

It starts by asking for God’s intercession, for Him to hear his cry. Then, the psalmist exposes his dire situation, where he recognizes his finitude, fragility and mortality. Then, he contrasts his own insignificance with God’a greatness, that is timeless and survives all generations. The psalmist praises the Lord for having looked down from heaven and having created the earth.

# Psalm 116
A thanksgiving psalm for salving the psalmist's life.

> *I said in my consternation,*  
     *“Men are all a vain hope.”*

Eucharistic prefiguration? Eucharist as sacrifice of thanksgiving:

     *and call on the name of the Lord,*
