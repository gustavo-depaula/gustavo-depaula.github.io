# Chapter 1
Instructions on how to make burnt offering to the Lord. The burnt offering is a sacrifice made for atonement (Lv 1:4).

**Analogical sense:**
1. The sacrifice of Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice. The laws concerning sacrifice in Leviticus is continued in the new testament through the Church’s liturgy, that has strict rules on how the sacrifice is represented to God, through the Mass.

# Chapter 2-3
Rules about cereal offerings and peace offerings.

# Chapter 4
Rules on sin offerings. Lev 4:28 talks about one of the requirements for mortal sin: full knowledge (_“when the sin which he has committed is made known to him”_).

# Chapter 5
When a person sins and knows about it, they need to confess their sin and bring and offering so that a priest makes atonement for their sin. (Lv 5:5, Lv 5:6)

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The New Testament continues this practice, when Jesus gives the apostles the authority to be mediators and to forgive and retain sins.
2. **Lv 5:7 Lv 5:11** In the same way God allows for those who can’t afford a lamb to bring two turtledoves/young pigeons, and for those who can’t even afford that to bring fine flour, God accepts our imperfect contrition in the Sacrament of Confession. By his infinite mercy, He meets us in the midst of our misery and imperfection, He just asks to offer what we have, whatever he have, even if it is almost nothing at all.
# Chapter 6
**Key themes:**
1. Faith is trust, and a sin against your neighbor is a sin against God. Thus, sins like deception or robbery are breaches of faith against the Lord. (Lv 6:2)
2. Repent requires the intention of amending the negative effects of your sin. (Lv 6:4-5)

# Chapter 7
**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Lv 7:19-21** Prefigures the eating of the flesh of the ultimate sacrifice, the Eucharist, and how it is a sacrilege to commune while carrying mortal sins.
2. Moreover, holy things are separated, dedicated for special uses and should be approached with purity.

# Chapter 8
**Key themes:**
1. Ordination offerings of Aaron and his sons. Profound and extended/long ritual.

# Chapter 9
**Key themes:**
1. Consecration of Aaron as priest, and his offering of sacrifices for him and for the people.
# Chapter 10
**Key themes:**
1. Separation of what is holy and common or unholy. Holy things are set apart from the rest. The punishment is great if holy things are mixed with unholy things: the fire of the Lord consumes Nadab and Abihu after they offered unholy fire.

**Moral sense:**
2. When you mix holy things with unholy things, you make the holy unholy.
3. To keep things holy, you need to set them apart, and protect them, and not make them common.
4. There is a danger in approaching the Divine things, as we can turn them into “routine” and lose the sense of profound mystery.
# Chapter 11
**Key themes:**
1. Laws for unclean and clean animals, and what actions related to animals make you unclean.

**Moral sense:**
1. Still teaching/preparing the people about holiness.
2. Natural insight: unclean animals are more dangerous and transmit more diseases. Also teaches quarantine and washing when you touch animal carcass. 

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Lv 11:45** *For I am the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God; **you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.***
2. **Matthew 5:48** *You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.*
# Chapter 12
**Key themes:**
1. Laws for unclean and clean states regarding giving birth, menstruation, and circumcision.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The Holy Family offers two young pigeons in Jesus’ presentation in the temple, as the law requires.

# Chapter 13
**Key themes:**
1. Ritual cleanliness laws and procedures for quarantine regarding skin diseases and leprosy. 
# Chapter 14
**Key themes:**
1. Continues the law on leprosy, on what to do with garments and the house.

**Lev 14:34** *“When you come into the land of Canaan, which I give you for a possession, **and I put a leprous disease** in a house in the land of your possession,”*
1. Same question with **“I hardened the Pharaoh’s heart”**. God allows leprosy to happen, but because of God’s sovereignty, His allowance is portrayed as active cause.
