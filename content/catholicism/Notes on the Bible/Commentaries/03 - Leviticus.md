# Commentary on Leviticus 1

Instructions on how to make burnt offering to the Lord. The burnt offering is a sacrifice made for atonement (Lv 1:4).

# Commentary on Leviticus 5

When a person sins and knows about it, they need to confess their sin and bring and offering so that a priest makes atonement for their sin. (Lv 5:5, Lv 5:6)

**Allegorical sense:**

1. The New Testament continues this practice, when Jesus gives the apostles the authority to be mediators and to forgive and retain sins.
2. **Lv 5:7 Lv 5:11** In the same way God allows for those who don’t afford a lamb to bring two turtledoves/young pigeons, and for those who can’t even afford that to bring fine flour, God accepts our imperfect contrition in the Sacrament of Confession. By his infinite mercy, He meets us in the midst of our misery and imperfection, He just asks to offer what we have, whatever he have, even if it is almost nothing at all.
