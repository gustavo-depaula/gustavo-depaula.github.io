# Chapter 1
Instructions on how to make burnt offering to the Lord. The burnt offering is a sacrifice made for atonement (Lv 1:4).

**Analogical sense:**
1. The sacrifice of Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice. The laws concerning sacrifice in Leviticus is continued in the new testament through the Church’s liturgy, that has strict rules on how the sacrifice is represented to God, through the Mass.
# Chapter 2-3
Rules about cereal offerings and peace offerings.
# Chapter 4
Rules on sin offerings. Lev 4:28 talks about one of the requirements for mortal sin: full knowledge (_“when the sin which he has committed is made known to him”_).
# Chapter 5
When a person sins and knows about it, they need to confess their sin and bring and offering so that a priest makes atonement for their sin. (Lv 5:5, Lv 5:6)

**Allegorical sense:**
1. The New Testament continues this practice, when Jesus gives the apostles the authority to be mediators and to forgive and retain sins.
2. **Lv 5:7 Lv 5:11** In the same way God allows for those who can’t afford a lamb to bring two turtledoves/young pigeons, and for those who can’t even afford that to bring fine flour, God accepts our imperfect contrition in the Sacrament of Confession. By his infinite mercy, He meets us in the midst of our misery and imperfection, He just asks to offer what we have, whatever he have, even if it is almost nothing at all.
# Chapter 6
**Key themes:**
1. Faith is trust, and a sin against your neighbor is a sin against God. Thus, sins like deception or robbery are breaches of faith against the Lord. (Lv 6:2)
2. Repent requires the intention of amending the negative effects of your sin. (Lv 6:4-5)
# Chapter 7
**Allegorical sense:**
3. **Lv 7:19-21** Prefigures the eating of the flesh of the ultimate sacrifice, the Eucharist, and how it is a sacrilege to commune while carrying mortal sins.
4. Moreover, holy things are separated, dedicated for special uses and should be approached with purity.

**Moral sense:**
4. When you mix holy things with unholy things, you make the holy unholy.
5. To keep things holy, you need to set them apart, and protect them, and not make them common.
6. There is a danger in approaching the Divine things, as we can turn them into “routine” and lose the sense of profound mystery.
# Chapter 11
**Key themes:**
7. Laws for unclean and clean animals, and what actions related to animals make you unclean.

**Moral sense:**
8. Still teaching/preparing the people about holiness.

11. **Matthew 5:48** *You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.*
# Chapter 12

4. Same question with **“I hardened the Pharaoh’s heart”**. God allows leprosy to happen, but because of God’s sovereignty, His allowance is portrayed as active cause.

**Questions:**
6. What are these bodily discharges that are referred?
# Chapter 16
**Key themes:**
7. God establishes a once-a-year ritual for washing the sins away of the people. This is the Yom Kippur, a solemn festival. The consecrated priests offer sacrifices for atonement for him and fot all the people, wearing the holy linen garments.

**Lv 16:22-23** Aaron must put upon a goat all the transgressions and iniquity of Israel, and then the goat bears their iniquities and is let go into the wilderness (to die basically), carrying away the sins of the people. This is the *scapegoat*. Is this a type of Christ? That bears our iniquities for us, cleaning us of our sins?

The procedures with well-defined garments, rituals, and the figure of the priest making sacrifices for himself and the whole people is very similar to how the apostolic churches (Catholic/Orthodox) conduct their liturgical rites today.

**Questions:**
1. Veil? Mercy seat?
# Chapter 17

2. Punishments for crimes in Chapter 18, basically, death penalty to all of them.
3. All the ritual laws have the purpose of making Israel *Holy*, not only in the sense of sacredness and sanctity, but to the most basic, that is, *separated*, *set apart* (Ex 20:26).
# Chapter 21
**Key themes:**
1. Priests are specially holy (set apart), because of their unique status of being consecrated to the LORD. Thus, they have stricter rule on ritual uncleanliness.

# Chapter 23
**Key themes:**

2. Establishes reward for obedient following of the Lord’s commandments and punishments for disobedience.
3. One of the punishments is scattering Israel among its enemies’ nations.
4. If they confess their iniquity (Lv 26:40), God will remember His covenant.

**Literal sense:**
1. It seems that the rewards/punishments are on a societal/group-level and not individual.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. **Lv 26:41** *“uncircumcised heart”*, circumcision as a symbol of purity. Circumcision in the new testament is Baptism that washes the soul.

**Questions:**
1. The catholic/orthodox position on icon veneration is that it was always allowed (and what was not allowed was idols) or that Christ incarnation changes this, as now there is a visible image of God?

# Chapter 27
**Key themes:**
1. Deals with voluntary vows and dedication (not mandatory). People could offer their “work value” to the temple as a symbol of offering themselves.
2. People could dedicate animals (if they weren’t firstborn), houses, and land. And had to pay a fifth more to redeem them.
3. The tithe was automatically God’s, and had to pay a fifth more to redeem it.
