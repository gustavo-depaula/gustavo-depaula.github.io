# Chapter 1

Elimelech and Naomi were from Bethlethem (Judah) and because of a great famine in the land, they went with their two sons, Mahlon and Chilion, to Moab. The two sons took Moabite wives, Orpah and Ruth.

Elimelech, Mahlon, and Chilion all died, leaving Naomi, Orpah, and Ruth alone. Naomi decides to go back to Bethlehem, and says to her daughters-in-law to go back to their mothers' houses. Orpah returns, but Ruth goes along with Naomi.

*Naomi* means pleasant, and *Mara* means bitter. So when Naomi arrives in Bethlehem, she says (v. 20) *"Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me."*.

# Chapter 2

Ruth provides for her and Naomi by working in a field gleaning grain in a field owned by Boaz, a relative of Elimelech. Although at first this was coincidental, Naomi later recognizes God's Providence at work. Boaz takes notice of her and acts with kindness towards her, and advises her to only work in his fields (as he can protect her).

Fields for the poor harvesting: Deut 24:19-21

# Chapter 3

Because Boaz is next of kin, he can fulfill the duties of the Levirate marriage, being a *"go'el"*, or redeemer. Naomi then sends Ruth in her best clothes after a harvest time feast and when Boaz is sleeping to ask him to be her redeemer.

Boaz accepts it, but only if the other man that has this right abdicates it.

The chapter uses the expression "uncover his feet" but it is unclear if it is a sexual euphemism or not. I'm leaning towards it not being, as usually "uncover nakedness" that it is used, and they are portrayed as just people, and sex outside of marriage is wrong. Especially as Boaz mentions the other name and waits for his response.

# Chapter 4

Boaz calls the next of kin and asks if he wants to redeem Naomi's properties and he initially accepts it, but when given the condition that he would have to marry Ruth, he declines it, as the condition of generating new heirs through Ruth would ruin his other children's inheritance.

Thus, Boaz redeems Ruth, marries her and they have a son. The son is Obed, father of Jesse, father of (future King) David.

# Notes

Boaz is a figure of Christ, the redeemer, and Ruth is a figure of the Church, the redeemed, who through charity and trust in God is saved.
