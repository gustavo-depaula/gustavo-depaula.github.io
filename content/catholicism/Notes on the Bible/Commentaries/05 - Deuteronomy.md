# Introduction
Deuteronomy means *second* (*deutero*) *law* (*nomy*). It is the second-law given by Moses after the first covenant the Lord ratified after the Exodus. This is situated 40 years after the Exodus, and ends with Moses’ death. The historical context is of Israel at the plains of Moab, within eyesight of the promised land.

The book gives a distinct Mosaic code, different from the laws of Exodus, Numbers, and Leviticus that pertain more to ethical, cerimonial, and worship laws, instead focusing on civic laws.

In structure, it closely resembles the Near Eastern vassal treaty, especially the Hittite model (circa 1400-1200 BC).

**Structure:**
1. Preamble (1:1-5)
2. *Historical prologue* (1:6-4:43)
3. *Stipulations*, rules of the covenant (4:44-26:19)
4. Sanctions, blessings and curses for obedience and disobedience (27:1-30:20)
5. *Succession arrangements* (31:1-34:12)

# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. Situates the narrative story as being in the first day of the eleventh month in the fortieth year, in the land of Moab, after having defeated the Amorites and Bashan.
2. God calls Israel to take the promised land.
3. Remembers the appointment of the Heads of the Tribes.
4. Israel didn’t want to go to the land of the Amorites, doubted God, thinking that He hated them, and was giving them to be destroyed by the Amorites.
5. God punished Israel’s rebellion by not giving the land to their generation and to Moses.
6. Israel was presumptuous and thought that they could fight the Amorites without the presence of God, but they were defeated.

**Moral sense:**
1. We cannot fight our spiritual warfare against sin without God.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Israel wandered in the desert for forty years, and in the mean time, passed through the lands of Esau, Moab, and Ammon. After the whole generation of men fit for war died, God commanded them to take land, starting with Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, totalling destroying them and destroying every city, men, women, and children.
2. The Lord has blessed other people and has given them land, which Israel should not take. Esau got Mount Seir; The sons of Lot (Moab) got Ar and the land of the sons of Ammon;
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. The conquest of Og, the King of Bashan, destroying every city, men, women, and children.
2. Moses gives the conquered land to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and to Manasseh.
3. Moses asks to God to go to the promised land, but God denies him (do not know the exact reason), but allows him to see the land standing upon a hill, and commands him to not ask anymore.
# Chapter 4
**Key themes:**
1. Following the Lord is wise and good. Moses prophesy an apostasy that will lead to Israel being scattered among the rival nations, but if they obey God again, as He is merciful, He will forgive them.
2. Reason for the graven image commandment (Dt 4:15-16): *“Since you saw no form, …”*. Thus, the Incarnation changes this.
3. Didn’t understand the cities of Dt 4:41-43.
# Chapter 5
**Key themes:**
1. Repeats the telling of the Ten Commandments, and how the people asked Moses to be a mediator between them and the Lord.
# Chapter 6
**Key themes:**
1. The great commandment (Deut 6:4-5): *"The Lord our God is one Lord; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might"*.
2. Be careful to not forget the Lord in the midst of material success, especially achieved with the divine help.
3. Instructions on explaining to future generations why we keep the commandments. (Deut 6:20-25)

It would be interesting to have a paragraph on explaining the Gospel in a succinct way.
# Chapter 7
**Key themes:**
1. When Israel enters the promised land, they must utterly destroy the 7 great rival nations that are bigger than them. There can be no negotiation or marriage, as they will lead their descendants astray from God.
2. The Lord has chosen Israel not because they where a great people, in fact, they were the smallest, but because the Lord loves them.
3. God is faithful to those who keep His commandments.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. We must destroy and root out sin from our life. The seven great rival nations are a prefiguration of the seven capital sins. (Deut 7:1-5)
2. It is not because of our own merit that God comes to rescue us, but because of love. It is because of His love that we are redeemed from the bondage of sin. (Deut 7:6-11)
3. It is not by our own power that we defeat sin, but through divine grace and help.
4. Sanctification and the battle against sin are a gradual process, be careful to not fight too many things at once, lest we be overwhelmed by them. (Deut 7:22)
5. Avoid occasions of sin. (Deut 7:26)

1. It is God that gives us the power to get wealth, it is not by our own hands. Be thankful and faithful.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. Promised land as a prefiguration of heaven, a land *“in which you will lack nothing”* (Deut 8:9)
# Chapter 9
**Key themes:**
1. The Lord is driving the enemy nations out the promised land not because of Israel’s righteousness, but because of the nations’ iniquity. In fact, Israel is a stubborn people that have disobeyed the Lord many times.
2. After the molten calf incident, Moses stayed 40 days and nights without bread and without water because of their sin, and prayed for Israel and Aaron, interceding for them.
# Chapter 10

2. The summary of the law: love and serve the Lord with all your heart and with all your soul.

4. Be careful to follow what the Lord has commanded, don't add or subtract from it.

**Questions:**
1. *"for the blood is the life"*. Why? Why they cannot eat it? Is it possible to be a eucharistic reference?

**Deut 15:19-23**
*"All the firstling males that are born of your herd and flock you shall consecrate to the Lord your God; you shall do no work with the firstling of your herd, nor shear the firstling of your flock. You shall eat it, you and your household, before the Lord your God year by year at the place which the Lord will choose. But if it has any blemish, if it is lame or blind, or has any serious blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to the Lord your God."* ^3c666d
