# Introduction
Deuteronomy means *second* (*deutero*) *law* (*nomy*). It is the second-law given by Moses after the first covenant the Lord ratified after the Exodus. This is situated 40 years after the Exodus, and ends with Moses’ death. The historical context is of Israel at the plains of Moab, within eyesight of the promised land.

The book gives a distinct Mosaic code, different from the laws of Exodus, Numbers, and Leviticus that pertain more to ethical, cerimonial, and worship laws, instead focusing on civic laws.

In structure, it closely resembles the Near Eastern vassal treaty, especially the Hittite model (circa 1400-1200 BC).

**Structure:**
1. Preamble (1:1-5)
2. *Historical prologue* (1:6-4:43)
3. *Stipulations*, rules of the covenant (4:44-26:19)
4. Sanctions, blessings and curses for obedience and disobedience (27:1-30:20)
5. *Succession arrangements* (31:1-34:12)

# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. Situates the narrative story as being in the first day of the eleventh month in the fortieth year, in the land of Moab, after having defeated the Amorites and Bashan.
2. God calls Israel to take the promised land.
3. Remembers the appointment of the Heads of the Tribes.
4. Israel didn’t want to go to the land of the Amorites, doubted God, thinking that He hated them, and was giving them to be destroyed by the Amorites.
5. God punished Israel’s rebellion by not giving the land to their generation and to Moses.
6. Israel was presumptuous and thought that they could fight the Amorites without the presence of God, but they were defeated.

**Moral sense:**
1. We cannot fight our spiritual warfare against sin without God.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Israel wandered in the desert for forty years, and in the mean time, passed through the lands of Esau, Moab, and Ammon.

2. The Lord has blessed other people and has given them land, which Israel should not take. Esau got Mount Seir; The sons of Lot (Moab) got Ar and the land of the sons of Ammon;
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. The conquest of Og, the King of Bashan, destroying every city, men, women, and children.
2. Moses gives the conquered land to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and to Manasseh.
