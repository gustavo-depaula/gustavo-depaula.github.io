Joshua, the successor of Moses, leads the Israelites to the promised land, through conquest wars. The narrative picks up right after Moses’ death in Deuteronomy. Joshua is a figure of Christ, with even Joshua and Jesus being written the same in Greek (Iesous). 
# Chapter 1
**Key themes:**
1. God commands Joshua to go into the promised land to conquer it, and gives a beautiful and motivating speech inspiring courage and faithfulness to the law. (Joshua 1:5-9)
2. Joshua commands the officers of the people to prepare for battle.

**Moral sense:**
1. We can be strong and of good courage precisely because we know the Lord is with us.
# Chapter 2
**Key themes:**
1. Spies are sent to Jericho and they stay and are protected by a harlot, and they make an oath to protect the harlot’s family because of it.
# Chapter 3
**Key themes:**
1. To cross the Jordan, priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant went first, in front of the people, and when they stepped on the water, the river stood back, allowing the people to cross the Jordan.
# Chapter 4
**Key themes:**
1. God, through Joshua, commands each tribe to get a stone to be a memorial for the people of Israel of the miracle of the crossing of the Jordan.

**Moral sense:**
1. It is so easy to forget what God has done for us, and the stones serve as a sensible and visual remembrance of what God has done for us.
# Chapter 5
**Key themes:**
1. The descendant generation of Israel was not circumcised, so the Lord commands Joshua to circumcise the people.
2. Manna ceased to be given, as they ate the fruits of the land.
3. An angel (?) is sent to be the commander of the army of the Lord (Israel? An angelic army?)

# Chapter 6
**Key themes:**
1. The siege and destruction of Jericho. Rahab (the harlot) and her family were spared.
# Chapter 7
**Key themes:**
1. Achan sinned by taking “devoted things” (that should have been destroyed) and stealing them for himself. Because of it, Israel lost the battle to Ai.

**Allegorical sense:**
1. Achan’s sin is an allegory to the lure and attachment to sin.
# Chapter 8
**Key themes:**
1. After dealing with Achan, Israel tried again conquering Ai, using an ambush technique, and were able to conquer and destroy the city.
# Chapter 9
**Key themes:**
1. The inhabitants of Gibeon (Gibeonites) feared Israel so deceived them by saying they lived far away to convince Israel to make a covenant with them.
2. When Israel found out the truth, they didn’t break the oath, and did not killed them, but they became servants to Israel.

Allegorical sense:
1. The Gibeonites‘ actions remember the Parable of the Unjust Steward, that uses dishonesty (the Gibeonites lying about their true origin / the steward forgiving the debts of his master’s debtors). Both of them are self-centered and use morally dubious means to achieve it. 
2. At the same time, it also shows how God accepts even our imperfect contrition and egotistic motives when approaching Him, if we are at least sincere in our desire to do so. The Gibeonites refusal to plot against Israel and instead seeking reconciliation also shows this, they recognize that is better to be alongside Israel than to fight God’s will.
3. The Gibeonites period as servants can be seen as a figure of purgatory, where the Gibeonites are paying the consequences of their wickedness, but are spared from eternal destruction. 
# Chapter 10
**Key themes:**
1. The Amorites form a coalition to attack Gibeon, which was a big city. The Gibeonites ask for help and Israel destroy the invaders. Joshua kills their kings (5).
2. Then, Israel conquer a ton of cities: Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Gezer, etc…
# Chapter 11
**Key themes:**
1. More kings make a coalition to fight Israel, but because the Lord was with Israel, they defeated and utterly destroyed all of them.
# Chapter 12
**Key themes:**
1. List of the kings and the land that Moses and Joshua conquered. Joshua conquered a total of 31 kings.
