2. **Lv 5:7 Lv 5:11** In the same way God allows for those who don't afford a lamb to bring two turtledoves/young pigeons, and for those who can't even afford that to bring fine flour, God accepts our imperfect contrition in the Sacrament of Confession. By his infinite mercy, He meets us in the midst of our misery and imperfection, He just asks to offer what we have, whatever he have, even if it is almost nothing at all.
