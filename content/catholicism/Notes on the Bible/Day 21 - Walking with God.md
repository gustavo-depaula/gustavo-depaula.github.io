# Commentary on Genesis 39–40
**Key theme**: Joseph suffers great injustices, but God was with him through everything, and he was blessed in the midst of the suffering.

Joseph is sold into the house of Potiphar, a high ranking official of the Pharaoh. He is a worthy servant and his lord prosper because of him, and his lord puts all that he has under Joseph’s rule.

Potiphar’s wife repeatedly asks for Joseph to lie with her, because he was good-looking, and probably because he was smart and capable. Joseph denies and runs every time, as it would be unfair to his master and a great sin to God. But the wife sets up a trap, when the house was empty, she asked again and grabbed his clothes. Joseph runs away, but afterwards, the wife lies to the other servants and to her husband saying that Joseph tried to lie with her.

Joseph is sent to prison, but God was with him, and he ends up taking care of the prison. The chief butler and baker of the Pharaoh are sent to prison, and they have dreams. Joseph, through God-given knowledge, interprets their dreams and predicts their fates.

**Worthy passages:**
1. Gen 39:21 *“But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him mercy”*
2. Gen 40:8 *“Do not interpretations belong to God?”*
	1. God’s revelation is not of personal interpretation.

**Allegorical sense:**
OT Joseph is a hard-worker and chaste, just like Saint Joseph.

**Moral sense:**
1. God is with us at all times, not only in the prosperity, when it is easy to see.
2. Do your best work even when you’re in unfair circumstances.
3. Don’t negotiate with lust, run away.
# Commentary on Job 31–32
Job reasserts his integrity, saying he has not committed iniquity, such as:
1. Lustful gazes
2. Being deceitful in business
3. Adultery
4. Despising, maltreatment of his servants
5. Ignoring people in need (the poor, the hungry, the widow)
6. Idolatry
7. Rejoicing in the suffering of the enemy
And proclaims self-curses if he has indeed committed them.

Elihu, the youngest, makes his first speech. He is angry at Job for saying he is just before the Lord. And angry at Job’s friends for not giving a real answer, only accusing Job of wrongdoing. 

He asserts that wisdom comes not from age, but from God. And basically gives a huge preamble that he *will* speak, and sees himself as an impartial judge.

**Worthy passages:**
1. Job 31:15 *“Did not he who made me in the womb make him?”*
	1. Master and servants are equal in dignity
2. Job 32:8-9 *“But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand. It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what is right”*
# Commentary on Proverbs 3:33-35
God shows favor to the humble, and scorns the prideful. According to St Jerome, *“Pride is evil because no excuse can be given for it.”*.
